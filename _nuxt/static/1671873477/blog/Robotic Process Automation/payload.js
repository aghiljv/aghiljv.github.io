With RPA, software users create software\n  robots, or “bots”, that can learn, mimic, and then execute rules-based\n  business processes. RPA automation enables users to create bots by observing\n  human digital actions. Show your bots what to do, then let them do the work.\n  Robotic Process Automation software bots can interact with any application or\n  system the same way people do—except that RPA bots can operate around the\n  clock, nonstop, much faster and with 100% reliability and precision.\n"}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[]},{type:b,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"How does Robotic Process Automation Work?"}]},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"\n  Robotic Process Automation bots have the same digital skillset as people—and\n  then some.
