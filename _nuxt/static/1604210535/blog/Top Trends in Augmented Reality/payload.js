Motorists can be alerted to hazards, providing\n  directions and given warnings about traffic.

ARCore\n  and ARKit based applications can already provide directions in airports,\n  malls, hospitals and office campuses. Last August, Google Maps launched a beta\n  version of its augmented reality walking directions feature that will\n  available to all AR-compatible Android and iOS mobile devices.
