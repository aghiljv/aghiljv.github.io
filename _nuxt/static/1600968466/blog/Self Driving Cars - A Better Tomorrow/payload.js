As a result, we’re likely to see the first\n  truly autonomous, commercially viable driverless cars hit the market in the\n  coming years. If that happens, autonomous vehicles have the potential to\n  improve our world and make everyday life that little bit easier. Here are five\n  ways I think society will benefit from autonomous cars.\n"}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:d,props:{},children:[]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:d,props:{},children:[]},{type:a,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"1.

This becomes increasingly realistic if the motorists of the future choose\n  not to purchase their own self-driving vehicle, but instead make use of\n  automated ride-sharing or taxi services. As an added bonus, with fewer people\n  needing to find a parking space, land that is currently used for huge car\n  parks could be repurposed for much-needed housing or attractive public spaces.\n  With this in mind, the city of Chandler in Arizona has already changed its\n  zoning laws to accommodate autonomous vehicles; developers will now be able to\n  build properties with fewer parking spaces, so long as they provide suitable\n  curb-side passenger loading zones. In other words, the buildings of the future\n  may no longer be flanked by huge, ugly car parks, and will instead favour\n  dedicated areas for drop-offs and pick-ups.\n"}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:d,props:{},children:[]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:d,props:{},children:[]},{type:a,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"2.

That’s the hope,\n  anyway. One study by the University of California, Davis suggests that\n  automated vehicles could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 80\n  percent by 2050 – but only if the vehicles are electric and shared. If we\n  don't transition towards more shared vehicles, then the worrying prediction is\n  emissions could actually increase (by as much as 50 percent by 2050, according\n  to the same study). This is because self-driving cars could make car ownership\n  possible for people who cannot drive, potentially increasing the number of\n  vehicles and miles driven. Therefore, this benefit is far from a foregone\n  conclusion. As a society, we’ll need to rethink our attitude towards car\n  ownership if we’re to reap the full environmental benefits of autonomous\n  vehicles.\n"}]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:d,props:{},children:[]},{type:b,value:c},{type:a,tag:d,props:{},children:[]},{type:a,tag:f,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"3.

Volvo’s vision is one of a luxurious, driverless\n  future in which a car can pick you up and take you wherever you need to go,\n  potentially eliminating the need for short-haul, domestic air travel. With\n  Volvo’s concept, you would be able to order a car, pre-order food and drink,\n  and then recline and relax in the back while the car transports you to your\n  destination. You then arrive fresh-faced and relaxed, having endured none of\n  the stress and exhaustion of plane travel.
