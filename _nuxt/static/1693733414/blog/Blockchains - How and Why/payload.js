Let’s assume, we have a chain of 3 blocks. Each block\n  has a hash and the hash of the previous block. So, block number 3 points to\n  block number 2 and number 2 points to number 1. Now the first block is a bit\n  special, it cannot point to previous blocks because it's the first one. We\n  call this the genesis block. Now let's say that you tamper with the second\n  block. This causes the hash of the block to change as well. In turn that will\n  make block 3 and all following blocks invalid because they no longer store a\n  valid hash of the previous block.

Computers these days are\n  very fast and can calculate hundreds of thousands of hashes per second. You\n  could effectively tamper with a block and recalculate all the hashes of other\n  blocks to make your blockchain valid again. So, to mitigate this, blockchains\n  have something called proof-of-work. It's a mechanism that slows down the\n  creation of new blocks. In Bitcoins case: it takes about 10 minutes to\n  calculate the required proof-of-work and add a new block to the chain. This\n  mechanism makes it very hard to tamper with the blocks, because if you tamper\n  with 1 block, you'll need to recalculate the proof-of-work for all the\n  following blocks.\n"}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"\n  So, the security of a blockchain comes from its creative use of hashing and\n  the proof-of-work mechanism.

When someone joins this\n  network, he gets the full copy of the blockchain. The node can use this to\n  verify that everything is still in order. Now let's see what happens when\n  someone creates a new block. That new block is send to everyone on the\n  network. Each node then verifies the block to make sure that it hasn't been\n  tampered with. If everything checks out, each node adds this block to their\n  own blockchain. All the nodes in this network create consensus. They agree\n  about what blocks are valid and which aren't. Blocks that are tampered with\n  will be rejected by other nodes in the network. So, to successfully tamper\n  with a blockchain you'll need to tamper with all blocks on the chain, redo the\n  proof-of-work for each block and take control of more than 50% of the\n  peer-to-peer network. Only then will your tampered block become accepted by\n  everyone else.
