One can make a\r\n  website more user-friendly and highly interactive applications with it. Things\r\n  like updating web pages, UI improvements including animations, interactive\r\n  maps, graphics, and much more can be created easily using JavaScript.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Many JavaScript frameworks and libraries have made their entrance over the\r\n  years. While some gets picked up some are left behind and eventually go\r\n  extinct. They were loved by the web development companies and have leveraged\r\n  their features to do their bidding.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  So, it is imperative now more than ever to keep up with the best of them as it\r\n  would be the wise choice for any web developer. Knowing multiple frameworks\r\n  will help you analyse your needs and choose the best option available rather\r\n  than wasting your time on another.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The term JavaScript Framework means a library that provides developers with\r\n  pre-built website templates and pre-written JavaScript code for standard\r\n  programming tasks. The use of which will phenomenally speed up the development\r\n  process.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  That being said, here are 5 frameworks that I think are the best int the\r\n  market.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>1. ReactJS</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/040520/react.png\" alt=\"pencil\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  ReactJS is an effective open-source Javascript Library used for making\r\n  interactive UIs. This quickly developing JS framework is utilised by website\r\n  admins to deal with the view layer of complex applications and sites. It is\r\n  quicker than Angular and ideal for those in need of a basic, quick and\r\n  versatile framework. The library is fundamentally a UI structure library,\r\n  however, it is a solid match for building responsive single-page applications\r\n  and cross-stage applications as well. It comes stacked with different\r\n  highlights, for example, little record size, adaptability, the similarity with\r\n  numerous libraries, and improved support process.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Notable users : Facebook, Netflix.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>2. VueJS</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/040520/vue.png\" alt=\"speed\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  One of he most celebrated and my personal favourite VueJS was made by Evan You\r\n  in 2014. It is open-source and lightweight and is used to create inventive\r\n  UIs. VueJS is intended to be versatile and make the UI development process\r\n  progressively sorted out. Angular as well as React is actually receiving\r\n  extreme challenge from VueJS as some describe it bring with the best of both\r\n  and less of their shortcomings. It is highly probable to surpass both of them\r\n  in the market. NuxtJS is a framework of VueJS that is also gaining popularity\r\n  as it enhances the already existing tremendous features of VueJS.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Notable users : Adobe, Behance.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>3. Angular</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/040520/angular.png\" alt=\"sharding\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Angular is one of the most proficient and well-known JavaScript frameworks\r\n  that give developers the best answers for consolidate JavaScript with HTML and\r\n  CSS. It is an open-source front-end web framework that permits programming\r\n  designers to assemble intuitive single-page web applications (SPA) like no\r\n  other. This full-highlights framework is a piece of celebrated LAMP and MEAN\r\n  stacks, and are considered by very good quality organisations in light of\r\n  points of interest like full arrangement of instruments, rich programming\r\n  style, enormous condition, and top-notch code age.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Notable users : Google, Microsoft.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>4. SvelteJS</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/040520/svelte.png\" alt=\"scalability\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  SvelteJS, an emerging framework, is similar to JavaScript frameworks such as\r\n  ReactJS and VueJS, but with a crucial difference. SvelteJS converts your app\r\n  into ideal JavaScript at build time, rather than interpreting your application\r\n  code at run time. This means you don't pay the performance cost of the\r\n  framework's abstractions, and you don't incur a penalty when your app first\r\n  loads. You can build your entire app with Svelte, or you can add it\r\n  incrementally to an existing codebase. You can also ship components as\r\n  standalone packages that work anywhere, without the overhead of a dependency\r\n  on a conventional framework.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Notable users : NY Times, Razorpay.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>5. EmberJS</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/040520/ember.png\" alt=\"adhoc\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  EmberJS is an open-source front-end JavaScript framework that enables software\r\n  engineers to fabricate versatile single-page, work area, and portable\r\n  applications. It chips away at the rule of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design\r\n  and is stuffed with a few stunning highlights to help developers along. It\r\n  comes stacked with different functionalities like higher consistency,\r\n  selective troubleshooting offices, and full-stack development choices that\r\n  make versatile application developers pick Ember over other such accessible\r\n  choices.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Notable users : LinkedIn, Heroku.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <h2\r\n    >Choosing a JavaScript framework for your business or application is not an\r\n    easy task.

Every good software that stood the\r\n  trial of time has undergone constant evolution. Google and Apple just didn’t\r\n  release Android and iOS respectively stood back. Both Operating Systems went\r\n  constant upgrades and are at stable versions of version 10 and 13 right now\r\n  and they are still evolving.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  All this just doesn’t happen by magic. They were required careful analysis,\r\n  planning and changes in the source code.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Changing any source can result in make rise to a number of problems. It is\r\n  common knowledge that when you make changes to your source code to accommodate\r\n  new features, it might result in unwelcome breakage at someplace else. The\r\n  technical explanation for this is, the code is tightly coupled in the\r\n  object-oriented programming.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  In object-oriented programming, application is broken down into tiny pieces\r\n  called classes which are responsible for taking care of certain functionality\r\n  of the software. One class could be handling logging while another is taking\r\n  care of database management.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  By breaking it down like this, the engineer avoids creating a giant monolithic\r\n  application. The resulting application and its components will be easier to\r\n  understand to not only the engineer/s who creates this, but also the engineers\r\n  who then later inherit the responsibility of maintaining the same. It also\r\n  helps understand how the components interact with each other.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  But object-oriented programming does have its perils. Chief among them being –\r\n  tight coupling. As mentioned before, classes will interact with each other to\r\n  make the software work. Classes cannot exist as independent and self-isolated\r\n  in object-oriented programming.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Since one class may need to depend on the services and functionality of one or\r\n  more other classes, changing the definition or functionality could cause\r\n  unwanted rippling effect on the classes that depend on them and that is called\r\n  tight coupling.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  This is where the knowledge of design patterns comes in handy. An engineer\r\n  could analyze the problem and then implement appropriate design pattern/s.\r\n  When implemented appropriately, this will make the code easier to modify. A\r\n  code that is easier to change is easy to maintain as well.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  But the design patterns have also opened doors for new problems as well.\r\n  Caused by the abuse of the same. They are called Anti-patterns.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b> Anti-Patterns </b> <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Throughout the brief history of software design and development, every new\r\n  programming language, every methodology was always thought by most to be the\r\n  ultimate solution. But as time goes on, every engineer would realize that\r\n  there has never been an ultimate solution or an “ultimate silver bullet\r\n  solution”.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  As in most, one thing that constant for software engineering is also change.\r\n  There will always be newer technology stacks, new programming languages and\r\n  new software design methodologies. Agile and Scrum are relatively new to the\r\n  game, but one day they too shall be replaced by something else. Something\r\n  better.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  But we can safely say that there is but one golden and universal design\r\n  pattern – KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b> KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) </b> <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img\r\n  style=\"width: 100%\"\r\n  src=\"/img/blog/070920/kiss.jpg\"\r\n  alt=\"KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)e\"\r\n/>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Every new line of code that we write is a new potential thing which can go\r\n  wrong. So, logically, the less we write, the time and effort we need to spend\r\n  fixing, maintaining or refactoring it will also be less. Any code you write\r\n  should be simple, easy to read by other engineers and easy to change, which is\r\n  easier said than done.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  But we might be inspired to do it always right if we think like the following.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <h2\r\n    >Always code as if the guy who ends up maintain your code will be a violent\r\n    psychopath who knows where you live.</h2\r\n  >\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the text belong solely to the\r\n  author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation, committee\r\n  or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/Design Patterns - Why and How","extension":".md","slug":"Design Patterns - Why and How","createdAt":"2020-09-10T14:49:58.810Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-04T05:20:26.177Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1601817281380},"$loki":7},{"name":"5 Mistakes Front-end Developers should Avoid","titleImage":"200420/frontMistake","briefdesc":"An article regarding usual mistakes made by most Front-end Developers/Engineers.","postDate":"April 20, 2020","toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"A front-end developer could easily avoid these common mistakes and ensure\n    that their site is easy to use and loads fast.

Perhaps, thanks to advancements in extended reality (XR), an umbrella\r\n  term used to describe immersive technologies that can merge the physical and\r\n  virtual worlds, you might be able to shop for a new home anywhere in the world\r\n  as if you were actually on-site or head to lunch in some faraway land. By\r\n  2022, the XR market is expected to reach $209 billion, which is eight times\r\n  what it is today. This tremendous growth could mean the realities of our 2030\r\n  lives are beyond our imagination’s ability to grasp.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>What is extended reality (XR)?</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  XR is an emerging umbrella term for all the immersive technologies. The ones\r\n  we already have today—augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed\r\n  reality (MR) plus those that are still to be created. All immersive\r\n  technologies extend the reality we experience by either blending the virtual\r\n  and “real” worlds or by creating a fully immersive experience. Recent research\r\n  revealed that more than 60% of respondents believed XR will be mainstream in\r\n  the next five years. To get a better picture of XR, let’s review each of the\r\n  existing technologies that exist today.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Virtual reality (VR)</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/100820/vrXr.jpg\" alt=\"VR\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  In virtual reality, users are fully immersed in a simulated digital\r\n  environment. Individuals must put on a VR headset or head-mounted display to\r\n  get a 360 -degree view of an artificial world that fools their brain into\r\n  believing they are, e.g., walking on the moon, swimming under the ocean or\r\n  stepped into whatever new world the VR developers created. The gaming and\r\n  entertainment industry were early adopters of this technology; however,\r\n  companies in several industries such as healthcare, construction, engineering,\r\n  the military, and more are finding VR to be very useful.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Augmented reality (AR)</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/100820/arXr.jpg\" alt=\"XR\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  In augmented reality, virtual information and objects are overlaid on the real\r\n  world. This experience enhances the real world with digital details such as\r\n  images, text, and animation. You can access the experience through AR glasses\r\n  or via screens, tablets, and smartphones. This means users are not isolated\r\n  from the real world and can still interact and see what’s going on in front of\r\n  them. The most well-known examples of AR are the Pokémon GO game that overlays\r\n  digital creatures onto the real world or Snapchat filters that put digital\r\n  objects such as hats or glasses onto your head.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Mixed reality (MR)</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/100820/mrXr.jpg\" alt=\"MR\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  In mixed reality, digital and real-world objects co-exist and can interact\r\n  with one another in real-time.

This primarily focuses on the use of large-scale\r\n  machine to machine communication (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT)\r\n  deployments to provide increased automation, improved communication and\r\n  self-monitoring, as well as smart machines that can analyse and diagnose\r\n  issues without the need for human intervention.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Like Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality is an overlay of digital content in to\r\n  the real world. But, the fact that content appears in form of hologram is what\r\n  makes it even more exciting to the eye and the Industry 4.0, along with a\r\n  plethora of other features.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>But what can Mixed Reality contribute to the Industry 4.0?</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>1. Speed up the Quality Control process</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img\r\n  style=\"width: 100%\"\r\n  src=\"/img/blog/220620/speedUpCP.jpg\"\r\n  alt=\"Speed up Control Process\"\r\n/>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Leveraging the use of overlaid information is also gaining supporters in\r\n  Quality Control, using both HMDs and handheld IoT devices. Aerospace is one\r\n  such sector where Quality Assurance is of huge importance, but the time and\r\n  costs of processes can be huge. Adding text, icons, images, 3D models, and\r\n  animations to real-world production lines means faster assembly – with fewer\r\n  mistakes. For example, since adopting mixed reality in their production\r\n  environments, Airbus has reported a reduction in time required to inspect A380\r\n  fuselage brackets, from three weeks to just three days.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>2. Minimize skilled labour shortage</b><br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  It is estimated that there will be almost 3.5 million manufacturing jobs\r\n  available over the next decade as ‘Baby Boomers’ exit the workforce. Already\r\n  dealing with pressure to fill current open positions, how can manufacturers\r\n  use mixed reality to help with future resourcing? The speed at which new staff\r\n  can be trained is one key factor. In addition, any valuable skills lost by\r\n  retiring workers can be retained in a mixed reality-led environment by using\r\n  remote support via HMDs. And when it comes to attracting the right talent, by\r\n  integrating new technologies familiar to a younger demographic, manufacturers\r\n  can experience a smoother on-boarding journey.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>3.

As a result, we’re likely to see the first\r\n  truly autonomous, commercially viable driverless cars hit the market in the\r\n  coming years. If that happens, autonomous vehicles have the potential to\r\n  improve our world and make everyday life that little bit easier. Here are five\r\n  ways I think society will benefit from autonomous cars.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>1. Easier Parking</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img\r\n  style=\"width: 100%\"\r\n  src=\"/img/blog/030820/parking.jpg\"\r\n  alt=\"Easier parking\"\r\n/>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  It's also hoped that autonomous vehicles will improve parking in congested\r\n  cities because driverless vehicles could simply drop passengers off and move\r\n  on. This becomes increasingly realistic if the motorists of the future choose\r\n  not to purchase their own self-driving vehicle, but instead make use of\r\n  automated ride-sharing or taxi services. As an added bonus, with fewer people\r\n  needing to find a parking space, land that is currently used for huge car\r\n  parks could be repurposed for much-needed housing or attractive public spaces.\r\n  With this in mind, the city of Chandler in Arizona has already changed its\r\n  zoning laws to accommodate autonomous vehicles; developers will now be able to\r\n  build properties with fewer parking spaces, so long as they provide suitable\r\n  curb-side passenger loading zones. In other words, the buildings of the future\r\n  may no longer be flanked by huge, ugly car parks, and will instead favour\r\n  dedicated areas for drop-offs and pick-ups.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>2. Emission Reduction</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/030820/emission.jpg\" alt=\"Emission\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  In the future, with the majority of self-driving vehicles being electric or\r\n  hybrids, and given the fact that autonomous vehicles drive more efficiently\r\n  than humans, we could see a serious reduction in emissions. That’s the hope,\r\n  anyway. One study by the University of California, Davis suggests that\r\n  automated vehicles could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 80\r\n  percent by 2050 – but only if the vehicles are electric and shared. If we\r\n  don't transition towards more shared vehicles, then the worrying prediction is\r\n  emissions could actually increase (by as much as 50 percent by 2050, according\r\n  to the same study). This is because self-driving cars could make car ownership\r\n  possible for people who cannot drive, potentially increasing the number of\r\n  vehicles and miles driven. Therefore, this benefit is far from a foregone\r\n  conclusion. As a society, we’ll need to rethink our attitude towards car\r\n  ownership if we’re to reap the full environmental benefits of autonomous\r\n  vehicles.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>3. Cutting domestic air travel</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img\r\n  style=\"width: 100%\"\r\n  src=\"/img/blog/030820/domesticTravel.jpg\"\r\n  alt=\"Domestic Travel\"\r\n/>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Volvo’s 360c concept car, which was unveiled in 2018, provides a glimpse of a\r\n  future in which self-driving cars are no longer just cars – they're places to\r\n  work, sleep, and relax. Almost a cross between a hotel room and the\r\n  first-class cabin of a plane. Volvo’s vision is one of a luxurious, driverless\r\n  future in which a car can pick you up and take you wherever you need to go,\r\n  potentially eliminating the need for short-haul, domestic air travel. With\r\n  Volvo’s concept, you would be able to order a car, pre-order food and drink,\r\n  and then recline and relax in the back while the car transports you to your\r\n  destination. You then arrive fresh-faced and relaxed, having endured none of\r\n  the stress and exhaustion of plane travel. Particularly for journeys that\r\n  could be made overnight, this vision could seriously disrupt the travel\r\n  industry – and cut the carbon footprint associated with travel.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>4. Making our roads safer</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/030820/saferRoad.jpg\" alt=\"Safety\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  While there have been some high-profile cases of autonomous vehicles being\r\n  involved in tragic fatal accidents, data suggests that self-driving cars will\r\n  ultimately make our roads safer.

In addition, you will need to destroy or delete any\r\n  graphics that is currently not in use or simply not in the vicinity of the\r\n  screen so as to save memory and hence providing better performance.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  So, if there was a system that could keep track of all the objects and\r\n  automatically destroy them it would make the process much easier. Creating\r\n  this system might also take up a lot more memory but will save hours of\r\n  development and that is a just trade-off.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  You might also have noticed that most of the games have objects, characters\r\n  and enemies. So better to create a system that can handle any game rather than\r\n  create the same thing over and over again. Enter game engines. Frameworks that\r\n  provides the tools and structure required for almost every game to function.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Today, the games can handle high complexities with much ease. But this was not\r\n  the case not so long ago. Memory was so limited and precious. Even 512KB was a\r\n  luxury.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>A game engine usually contains five components.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside\">\r\n  <li>Game logic.</li>\r\n  <li>Rendering engine - to generate 3D animated graphics.</li>\r\n  <li>Audio engine – with algorithms related to sounds.</li>\r\n  <li>Physics engine- to implement the physical laws and</li>\r\n  <li>Artificial Intelligence.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/210920/newGames.jpg\" alt=\"New Games\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Third-party game engines became popular since the rise for the demand of 3D\r\n  games. Studios started to use them in order to speed up the development\r\n  process. But still most companies prefer cooking up their own game engines.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Third-party game engines will save you a lot of time in development while\r\n  in-house game engines will help you achieve better optimization. Obvious\r\n  choices as third -party game engines would have been Unreal Engine and Unity\r\n  3D for a long time.
