It took around 3 decades still to see something promising and even\n  though slow, the work has been proceeding from there. In the 1980s, Carnegie\n  Mellon University’s Navlab and ALV projects (1984) and Mercedes-Benz and\n  Bundeswehr University Munich’s Eureka Prometheus Project (1987) were a\n  significant leap forward.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  With the media coverage, it may feel like autonomous vehicles are already\n  among us, they are not quite as smart as portrayed in pop culture yet. Let’s\n  examine the levels of autonomous vehicles.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>1. Level 0 – No Automation</b><br /><br />\n<p>\n  This is your ordinary car, sometimes equipped with cruise control and that’s\n  it. Most of the vehicles on the road still fall under this category.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>2. Level 1 – Driver Assistance</b><br /><br />\n<p>\n  This is the level in which you will find the adaptive cruise control and lane\n  keep assist to help the driver. Adaptive cruise control will keep a safe\n  distance between the vehicle you are in and the vehicle ahead with the help of\n  RADARs and/or cameras. It will apply brakes when traffic slows down and resume\n  the speed when the traffic clears. Lane keep assist will tap you back into the\n  lane if you deviate from it. Mind you, these systems are in place to assist\n  the driver. It still requires the driver to be in control. 2018 Toyota Corolla\n  and 2018 Nissan Sentra are examples of Level 1 cars.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>3. Level 2 – Partial Automation</b><br /><br />\n<p>\n  This is the level where it gets interesting. The cars in this level can assist\n  in controlling speed as well as steering. But the driver must have hands on\n  the wheel and be ready to take control at any given moment. It will help you\n  keep centred on a lane. Also, it will help with stop-and-go traffic by\n  maintaining distance between you and the vehicle in front of you. Tesla\n  Autopilot, Volvo Pilot Assist, Audi Traffic Jam assist are some examples.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>4.

Blind Spot Monitoring</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  Blind spot detection systems use sensors to provide drivers with important\n  information that is otherwise difficult or impossible to obtain. Some systems\n  sound an alarm when they detect an object in the driver’s blind spot, such as\n  when the driver tries to move into an occupied lane.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>9. Automatic Emergency Braking</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  Automatic emergency braking uses sensors to detect whether the driver is in\n  the process of hitting another vehicle or other objects on the road. This\n  application can measure the distance of nearby traffic and alert the driver to\n  any danger. Some emergency braking systems can take preventive safety\n  measures, such as tightening seat belts, reducing speed, and adaptive steering\n  to avoid a collision.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>10. Crosswind Stabilization</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  This relatively new ADAS feature supports the vehicle in counteracting strong\n  crosswinds. The sensors in this system can detect strong pressure acting on\n  the vehicle while driving and apply brakes to the wheels affected by crosswind\n  disturbance.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>11. Driver Drowsiness Detection</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  Driver drowsiness detection warns drivers of sleepiness or other road\n  distractions. There are several ways to determine whether a driver’s attention\n  is decreasing. In one case, sensors can analyze the movement of the driver’s\n  head, and heart rate to determine whether they indicate drowsiness. Other\n  systems issue driver alerts similar to the warning signals for lane detection.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>12. Driver Monitoring System</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  The driver monitoring system is another way of measuring the driver’s\n  attention. The camera sensors can analyze whether the driver’s eyes are on the\n  road or drifting. Driver monitoring systems can alert drivers with noises,\n  vibrations in the steering wheel, or flashing lights. In some cases, the car\n  will take the extreme measure of stopping the vehicle completely.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n<h2>Automobiles are the foundation of the next generation of mobile-connected\n  devices, with rapid advances being made in autonomous vehicles.</h2>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to\n  the author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation,\n  committee or other group or individual.\n</p>\n<br /><br /><br />\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/ADAS","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-10-08T18:38:04.811Z","updatedAt":"2023-10-08T18:38:04.811Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1696790354374},"$loki":7},{"slug":"Ambient Intelligence","name":"Ambient Intelligence","titleImage":"080321/title","briefdesc":"A small introduction to the developing concept of Ambient Intelligence.","postDate":"March 07, 2021","blogNumber":49,"toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"As a result of maturing AmI research, the resulting technologies promise to\n  revolutionize daily human life by making people’s surroundings flexible and\n  adaptive."}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n  Ambient Intelligence or AmI refers to electronic environments that are\n  responsive and sensitive to the presence of people.

Since that time, we have\n  developed increasingly fluid methods for human-computer interaction with\n  keyboards, mouses, monitors and touchscreens which now dominate our digital\n  lives. But what if we could link the computational wetware in our own heads\n  directly with a computer.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Brain computer interfaces or BCI's could include either input or output\n  devices. Input BCI's are comprised of sensors which acquire electrical brain\n  wave signals together with processing hardware that extracts distinct features\n  and translates them into useful commands. The other way around output BCI's\n  translate digital information into electrical signals that are fed into the\n  user’s brain by electrode arrays or other stimulator hardware.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  BCI's may be constructed using one of two approaches.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  The first is non-invasive and may employ electroencephalography or EEG to\n  acquire brainwave signals from sensors positioned on the outside of the skull.\n  Alternatively, non invasive BCI's may feed electrical signals into the brain\n  using a TMS or Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation device.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  The second way to build a BCI is invasive and currently requires surgery to\n  position sensors or stimulators inside the skull. Two output technologies have\n  so far been trialled, with the first known as electrocorticography or ECoG,\n  placing a strip or grid of electrodes on the surface of the brain.\n  Alternatively, intracortical microelectrodes can be implanted a few\n  millimetres into the brain where they may serve as either sensors or\n  stimulators.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  For obvious reasons today most BCI research is non-invasive. This limits its\n  scope and application but even so some interesting results have been achieved.\n  Perhaps most notably, many researchers have used EEG to acquire P300 brain\n  waves which are then processed to allow a user to input letters or commands\n  into a computer. Such interfaces are painstakingly slow, but without doubt\n  they can work.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Researchers at the University of Washington have even used non-invasive BCI's\n  to send commands from one person's brain to another over the Internet.\n  Specifically, in a set of experiments in 2014 one test subject wore an EEG\n  skullcap while watching a monitor screen on which a computer game was being\n  displayed. But the fire button was in the hand of a second subject seated half\n  a mile away in another building and who had a TMS coil placed over the brain.\n  To shoot down Rockets the first user had to think about pressing the fire\n  button. When that happened, brainwave signals were acquired by EEG, processed\n  and transmitted over the Internet. In turn the TMS device induced an\n  electrical pulse into the receiving subject’s brain so causing them to\n  experience visual stimuli and press the fire button. Amazingly the\n  split-second accuracy required to shoot down Rockets was achieved. In fact,\n  across three pairs of test subjects, success rate between 25% and 83% was\n  obtained.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  In time, University of Washington researchers hope to use BCI's to transmit\n  more complex ideas and thoughts from one brain to another. This could even\n  allow for what they call brain tutoring in which knowledge is transferred\n  directly from the brain of a teacher to the brain of a student. The team at\n  the University of Washington use highly sophisticated sensors stimulators and\n  processing hardware.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  However basic EEG BCI's are now available for consumers including the Emotiv\n  EPOC, the InteraXon Muse and the Neurosky MindWave.

In computer science, cryptography refers to secure\n  information and communication techniques derived from mathematical concepts\n  and a set of rule-based calculations called algorithms, to transform messages\n  in ways that are hard to decipher. These deterministic algorithms are used for\n  cryptographic key generation, digital signing, verification to protect data\n  privacy, web browsing on the internet and confidential communications such as\n  credit card transactions and email.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Cryptography is closely related to the disciplines of cryptology and\n  cryptanalysis. It includes techniques such as microdots, merging words with\n  images and other ways to hide information in storage or transit. However, in\n  today's computer-centric world, cryptography is most often associated with\n  scrambling plaintext (ordinary text, sometimes referred to as cleartext) into\n  ciphertext (a process called encryption), then back again (known as\n  decryption). Individuals who practice this field are known as cryptographers.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Modern cryptography concerns itself with the following four objectives:\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>1. Confidentiality</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  The information cannot be understood by anyone for whom it was unintended.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>2. Integrity</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  The information cannot be altered in storage or transit between sender and\n  intended receiver without the alteration being detected.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>3. Non-repudiation</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  The creator/sender of the information cannot deny at a later stage his or her\n  intentions in the creation or transmission of the information.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>4. Authentication</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  The sender and receiver can confirm each other's identity and the\n  origin/destination of the information.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Procedures and protocols that meet some or all of the above criteria are known\n  as cryptosystems. Cryptosystems are often thought to refer only to\n  mathematical procedures and computer programs. However, they also include the\n  regulation of human behaviour, such as choosing hard-to-guess passwords,\n  logging off unused systems, and not discussing sensitive procedures with\n  outsiders.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Cryptosystems use a set of procedures known as cryptographic algorithms or\n  ciphers, to encrypt and decrypt messages to secure communications among\n  computer systems, devices such as smartphones and applications. A cipher suite\n  uses one algorithm for encryption, another algorithm for message\n  authentication and another for key exchange. This process, embedded in\n  protocols and written in software that runs on operating systems and networked\n  computer systems, involves public and private key generation for data\n  encryption/decryption, digital signing and verification for message\n  authentication, and key exchange.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Cryptographic algorithms can be broadly classified to two types.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Single-key or symmetric-key encryption</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  Single-key or symmetric-key encryption algorithms create a fixed length of\n  bits known as a block cipher with a secret key that the creator/sender uses to\n  encipher data (encryption) and the receiver uses to decipher it. Types of\n  symmetric-key cryptography include the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), a\n  specification established in November 2001 by the National Institute of\n  Standards and Technology as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS\n  197), to protect sensitive information. The standard is mandated by the U.S.\n  government and widely used in the private sector. In June 2003, AES was\n  approved by the U.S. government for classified information. It is a\n  royalty-free specification implemented in software and hardware worldwide. AES\n  is the successor to the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and DES3. It uses\n  longer key lengths (128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit) to prevent brute force and\n  other attacks.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Public-key or asymmetric-key encryption</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  Public-key or asymmetric-key encryption algorithms use a pair of keys, a\n  public key associated with the creator/sender for encrypting messages and a\n  private key that only the originator knows (unless it is exposed or they\n  decide to share it) for decrypting that information. The types of public-key\n  cryptography include RSA, used widely on the internet, Elliptic Curve Digital\n  Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) used by Bitcoin, Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)\n  adopted as a Federal Information Processing Standard for digital signatures by\n  NIST in FIPS 186-4 and Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

The\n  resources will include everything from HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc. Simply put,\n  the browser will gather everything that needs to be displayed.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  <b>2.

As you can see in\n  the image above, there is a root html element. Then, head and body. Then there\n  are more and more nested tags inside both and it goes on and on. The browser\n  will create this DOM from the html resource that was gathered in step 1. DOM\n  is regulated by W3 and well documented. Even if the one(s) who wrote the code\n  for got to close some tags, the browser will still go ahead with rectifying\n  those small mistakes and displaying the page.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  <b>3.

The CSS files gathered will be made use of to do this\n  action. The CSS file(s) will contain the styling for all the elements in the\n  DOM tree. One major difference between the DOM tree and render tree would be,\n  the render tree would only contain the elements that are to be displayed in\n  the browser. So, if a DOM object has its styling as “display:none;”, it will\n  not be present in the render tree.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  <b>4.

Some\n  theories/knowledge to acquire before pushing ahead are:\n</p>\n<br />\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside\">\n  <li>Servers and their functioning.</li>\n  <li>Networks and their nuances.</li>\n  <li>Web-hosting environments.</li>\n  <li>Algorithms and their formulation.</li>\n  <li>Data structures (types, properties, and use).</li>\n  <li>Programming technologies.</li>\n  <li>Databases and their management</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<p>\n  You should be able to piece together the different parts of the application\n  and create a whole out of the parts. For this, you should understand how each\n  part works, its role in the bigger scheme of things and how one part connects\n  to the other.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>3. Become familiar with all technologies but a master of one</b\n><br /><br />\n<p>\n  As the scope of your leaning expands, you will realize that there is much more\n  to learn than you possibly can master. Most programmers fail because they try\n  to learn too much of too many things. There is no need for such efforts.\n  Master one and understand the rest. Learn how to work in them and that should\n  be good enough.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  As your experience grows, your ease with the technologies will also improve.\n  Take pains to specialize in one technology. Choose a technology popular among\n  clients. This should help you compete effectively with others in the field and\n  produce outstanding work. And with the way this economy is growing with lower\n  taxes, you should have a bright career ahead and be able to relocate other\n  states if you wish to.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>4. Get practical exposure</b><br /><br />\n<p>\n  The most challenging part of the process is when you have a thorough\n  understanding of all the necessary technologies—HTML/CSS, JavaScript, back-end\n  programming, databases, and HTTP/REST. Time has come to use all this knowledge\n  in an application. For this, you need to know:\n</p>\n<br />\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside\">\n  <li>The right way to structure code.</li>\n  <li>Means to separate files.</li>\n  <li>Environment to host large media files.</li>\n  <li>The right data structures to use.</li>\n  <li>Location of each computational task (client-side or server-side).</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Theoretical knowledge can be obtained by reading online materials, but to\n  understand application architecture properly, you must implement an actual web\n  application.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Working with a team is the ideal way to accomplish this through an individual\n  can also develop an application alone. This exercise adds the all-essential\n  practical exposure to the technology toolkit of a full-stack engineer.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  A few companies may insist on an applicant having a degree in computer science\n  to apply for the position, but most will overlook education if a candidate can\n  exhibit the necessary coding abilities.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>5. Take up additional assignments</b><br /><br />\n<p>\n  Join additional projects in your company that work on technologies outside\n  your expertise. This way you will upskill and add extra value to your\n  organization as well. Most companies will appreciate these types of\n  initiatives — just don’t try to show anyone up and courteous in your pursuit\n  of learning.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to the\n  author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation, committee\n  or other group or individual.\n</p>\n<br /><br /><br />\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/How to be a Full Stack Engineer","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-10-08T18:38:04.811Z","updatedAt":"2023-10-08T18:38:04.811Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1696790354547},"$loki":21},{"slug":"How to be an effective Engineer","name":"How to be an effective Engineer?","titleImage":"280920/eeTitle","briefdesc":"The necessary skills needed for any software engineer.","postDate":"September 28, 2020","blogNumber":26,"toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"If we have these skills, we can learn new languages and tools much quicker\n  and create exceptional software."}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n  Every software engineer or developer might have asked this question to\n  themselves or to their colleagues at some point.

This primarily focuses on the use of large-scale\n  machine to machine communication (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT)\n  deployments to provide increased automation, improved communication and\n  self-monitoring, as well as smart machines that can analyse and diagnose\n  issues without the need for human intervention.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Like Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality is an overlay of digital content in to\n  the real world. But, the fact that content appears in form of hologram is what\n  makes it even more exciting to the eye and the Industry 4.0, along with a\n  plethora of other features.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>But what can Mixed Reality contribute to the Industry 4.0?</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>1. Speed up the Quality Control process</b><br />\n<br />\n<img\n  style=\"width: 100%\"\n  src=\"/img/blog/220620/speedUpCP.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Speed up Control Process\"\n/>\n<br /><br />\n<p>\n  Leveraging the use of overlaid information is also gaining supporters in\n  Quality Control, using both HMDs and handheld IoT devices. Aerospace is one\n  such sector where Quality Assurance is of huge importance, but the time and\n  costs of processes can be huge. Adding text, icons, images, 3D models, and\n  animations to real-world production lines means faster assembly – with fewer\n  mistakes. For example, since adopting mixed reality in their production\n  environments, Airbus has reported a reduction in time required to inspect A380\n  fuselage brackets, from three weeks to just three days.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>2. Minimize skilled labour shortage</b><br /><br />\n<p>\n  It is estimated that there will be almost 3.5 million manufacturing jobs\n  available over the next decade as ‘Baby Boomers’ exit the workforce. Already\n  dealing with pressure to fill current open positions, how can manufacturers\n  use mixed reality to help with future resourcing? The speed at which new staff\n  can be trained is one key factor. In addition, any valuable skills lost by\n  retiring workers can be retained in a mixed reality-led environment by using\n  remote support via HMDs. And when it comes to attracting the right talent, by\n  integrating new technologies familiar to a younger demographic, manufacturers\n  can experience a smoother on-boarding journey.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>3. Improve employee training</b><br />\n<br />\n<img\n  style=\"width: 100%\"\n  src=\"/img/blog/220620/improveTraining.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Improve training\"\n/>\n<br /><br />\n<p>\n  Whether class-based or following study guides in the form of books and online\n  courses, training sessions can now be enhanced or even replaced using mixed\n  reality. Users can be guided step-by-step through modules, with training\n  information overlaid onto real-world parts and assemblies in front of them;\n  reducing the time needed to improve worker’s skill sets. There may also be\n  less need to remove staff from the production line, since training can take\n  place on-the-job. BAE Systems have introduced this concept on one of their\n  production lines, for electric propulsion systems. Not only have they\n  witnessed a more efficient training output, they have cut time taken to create\n  the training modules as well as cost; which is now a tenth of what it was.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<br /><b>4. Stay competitive</b><br /><br />\n<p>\n  Combining the benefits of mixed reality with the analytics-driven power of IoT\n  can leverage significant improvements. The potential opportunities are huge;\n  and with the industry predicted to grow to US$108bn by 2021, new innovations\n  will be emerging rapidly. Together, these technologies are set to contribute\n  greatly towards the Industry 4.0 movement; capturing and contextualizing data,\n  and automating manufacturing processes to optimize efficiency and reduce\n  waste.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>5. Reduce call out times for maintenance</b><br /><br />\n<p>\n  Organizations that used to rely on engineers, working with heavy and often\n  outdated manuals, are now using mixed reality to dramatically cut call out\n  times. One such company is elevator manufacturer ThyssenKrupp. Engineers\n  equipped with HMDs not only get the most up-to-date information, they also\n  view this hands-free; greatly reducing the time needed to knowledge-check.

It is not difficult for companies to\n  link your smart phone with your laptop, your in-home voice assistant, your\n  house or car cameras and maybe your cell phone records. Suddenly, companies\n  can know a lot more about you - your interests, dislikes, the way you vote and\n  the way you purchase.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Companies are increasingly using such information to inform how they sell, but\n  it is not all targeted advertising. Data reaped from the IoT can be used for\n  other reasons:\n</p>\n<br />\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside\">\n  <li>Health providers can measure the activation and engagement efforts of\n    patients.</li>\n  <li>Organizations can test the effectiveness of their campaigns, both\n    commercial and non-profit.</li>\n  <li>Policymakers could even personalize content, affecting laws and current\n    programs.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Companies using the IoT to get us to change our behaviours is not really about\n  the “things” at all. As the IoT links people with their actions, we have\n  verged into the Internet of Behaviour. Consider the IoB a combination of three\n  fields:\n</p>\n<br />\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside\">\n  <li>Technology.</li>\n  <li>Data analytics.</li>\n  <li>Behavioural science.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<p>\n  We can break behavioural science into four areas we consider when we use\n  technology:\n</p>\n<br />\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside\">\n  <li>Emotions.</li>\n  <li>Decisions.</li>\n  <li>Augmentations.</li>\n  <li>Companionship..</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<p>\n  As companies learn more about us (the IoT), they can affect our behaviours.\n  Consider a health app on your smartphone that tracks your diet, sleep\n  patterns, heart rate, or blood sugar levels. The app can alert you to adverse\n  situations and suggest behaviour modifications towards a more positive or\n  desired outcome.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  For now, companies mostly use the IoT and IoB to observe and attempt to change\n  our behaviour to achieve their desired goal—to purchase, typically.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Marketers and behaviour scientists tend to agree that this personalization is\n  key to a service’s effectiveness. The more effective a service, the more a\n  customer will continue to engage with it, and even alter their behaviour\n  because of it. Understanding that this personalization provides value to us,\n  customers might still avoid it because it feels creepy. This psychological\n  discomfort can cause us to avoid it, a tendency known as the ostrich effect.\n</p>\n<br /><b>Value for individual, gain for company</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  The IoB influences consumer choice, but it also redesigns the value chain.\n  While a majority of consumers indicate unhappiness at giving away their data\n  for free, many are satisfied with doing so as long as it brings them an added\n  value.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Pulling from the IoT, insurance and banking companies can provide data-driven\n  value. Optimize your individual premium based on health habits or a clean\n  driving record. Nudge you towards more saving, investing, or other long-term\n  financial goals.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Also, the health app that tracks our diet, sleep, heart rate and blood sugar\n  might prompt us into certain behaviours, like losing weight or going on a\n  diet. Without proper medical guidance, we may alter our behaviour too much or\n  too aggressively. But we must also keep in mind that, the apps we use to\n  assist us are commercial, so their health provenance is dubious and they have\n  their own goals: sell.\n</p>\n<br /><b>Security and Privacy Concerns</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  The IoT itself is not inherently problematic. A lot of people like having\n  their devices synced and get benefits and convenience from this setup.\n  Instead, the concern is how we gather, navigate and use the data, particularly\n  at scale. We are now starting to understand this problem.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  It is not just the devices themselves.

Significant man hours have\n  gone to waste and so have many applications built during it just by failing to\n  understand the same. The end-user or client needs cannot usually be determined\n  by one single meeting. It requires good research and understanding the problem\n  statement first-hand.

Sure, you could actually make the software\n  development process much faster, but usually at the expense of compromising\n  some vital steps. The applications developed skipping these “non-essential\n  steps” might sooner or later become a big problem. It might be true that you\n  could save the time and resources while building it in the first place. But,\n  when (not if) it comes back with bugs, it will cost you more of both.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>3.

But this\n  process is about to meet its physical limits. Computer parts are approaching\n  the size of an atom. To understand why this is a problem, we have to clear up\n  some basics.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  A computer is made up of very simple components doing very simple things.\n  Representing data, the means of processing it, and control mechanisms.\n  Computer chips contain modules, which contain logic gates, which contain\n  transistors.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  A transistor is the simplest form of a data processor in computers, basically\n  a switch that can either block, or open the way for information coming\n  through. This information is made up of bits which can be set to either 0 or\n  1. Combinations of several bits are used to represent more complex\n  information. Transistors are combined to create logic gates which still do\n  very simple stuff. For example, an AND Gate sends an output of 1 if all of its\n  inputs are 1, and an output of 0 otherwise.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Combinations of logic gates finally form meaningful modules, say, for adding\n  two numbers. Once you can add, you can also multiply, and once you can\n  multiply, you can basically do anything. Since all basic operations are\n  literally simpler than first grade math.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  However, with parts getting tinier and tinier, quantum physics are making\n  things tricky. In a nutshell, a transistor is just an electric switch.\n  Electricity is electrons moving from one place to another. So, a switch is a\n  passage that can block electrons from moving in one direction.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Today, a typical scale for transistors is 14 nanometres, which is about 8\n  times less than the HIV virus' diameter and 500 times smaller than a red blood\n  cell. As transistors are shrinking to the size of only a few atoms, electrons\n  may just transfer themselves to the other side of a blocked passage via a\n  process called Quantum Tunnelling.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  In the quantum realm, physics works quite differently from the predictable\n  ways we're used to, and traditional computers just stop making sense. We are\n  approaching a real physical barrier for our technological progress. To solve\n  this problem, scientists are trying to use these unusual quantum properties to\n  their advantage by building quantum computers.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  In normal computers, bits are the smallest unit of information.

From there, you could have this technology through NVIDIA’s RTX\n  lineup.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Ray tracing has actually been around for long back before 2018 though. Movies\n  and TV shows have been using it to create amazing CG which entertained us with\n  incredible and real-life like visuals. What NVIDIA has produced (and soon, AMD\n  as well) is Real-time Ray tracing. Ray tracing requires a lot of horsepower,\n  which simply wasn’t a trait the predecessors of NVIDIA RTX lineup. Now, we can\n  render the same effects in everyday computers and as a result, we now have ray\n  tracing games.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>So, what is ray tracing?</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Ray tracing is a rendering technique that can produce incredibly realistic\n  lighting effects. An algorithm can trace the path of light and simulate the\n  way the light interacts with the virtual objects it hits in the computer\n  generated world.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\n  style=\"width: 100%\"\n  src=\"/img/blog/200720/control.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Control Ray tracing\"\n/>\n<br /><br />\n<p>\n  The lighting effects in games have been becoming more and more realistic over\n  the years. But, the benefits of ray tracing are much more about how it\n  interacts with the world rather than the light itself.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Ray tracing improves translucence and scattering along with lifelike shadows\n  and reflections. Where the light hits is taken into account by the algorithm\n  and it calculates the interaction and interplay much like the human eye would\n  process real light, reflections and shadows.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  With enough computational power at your disposal, it is possible to produce\n  astonishingly realistic computer generated environments that are\n  indistinguishable from real life. But, that has been the problem: most gaming\n  PCs only has so much GPU power to work with, let alone a modern gaming\n  console.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Ray tracing have been in use for movies and TV shows because studios have had\n  the capital and capability to harness the power from a server farm or cloud\n  computing to get the job done. But still, it might take long hours to get the\n  results. Previously, doing it all on the fly has been far too taxing for\n  existing hardwares.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Video games have used rasterization, traditionally. It is a faster way to\n  render computer graphics. It converts 3D graphics into 2D pixels to display on\n  the screen, but requires shaders to depict realistic lighting. But the shift\n  has now started and more and more games have now started to take advantage of\n  the latest hardware that now NVIDIA seemingly has a monopoly over, to use the\n  real time ray tracing.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Even after nearly two years since it has been introduced to the market, the\n  results, if I may are not super mind-blowing. But it is getting better by\n  time.

With RPA, software users create software\n  robots, or “bots”, that can learn, mimic, and then execute rules-based\n  business processes. RPA automation enables users to create bots by observing\n  human digital actions. Show your bots what to do, then let them do the work.\n  Robotic Process Automation software bots can interact with any application or\n  system the same way people do—except that RPA bots can operate around the\n  clock, nonstop, much faster and with 100% reliability and precision.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>How does Robotic Process Automation Work?</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  Robotic Process Automation bots have the same digital skillset as people—and\n  then some. Think of RPA bots as a Digital Workforce that can interact with any\n  system or application. For example, bots are able to copy-paste, scrape web\n  data, make calculations, open and move files, parse emails, log into programs,\n  connect to APIs, and extract unstructured data. And because bots can adapt to\n  any interface or workflow, there’s no need to change business systems,\n  applications, or existing processes in order to automate.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  RPA bots are easy to set up, use, and share. If you know how to record video\n  on your phone, you’ll be able to configure RPA bots. It’s as intuitive as\n  hitting record, play, and stop buttons and using drag-and-drop to move files\n  around at work. RPA bots can be scheduled, cloned, customized, and shared to\n  execute business processes throughout the organization.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Some of the benefits of RPA include:\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Greater Productivity</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  RPA bots create step-change in employee productivity by accelerating workflows\n  and enabling more work to get done by executing processes independently. In\n  document-intensive industries like financial services, insurance and in the\n  public sector, RPA bots can handle form filling and claims processing all\n  hands-free.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Integrate Across Platforms</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  RPA is application agnostic so you’ll never need to upgrade or replace\n  existing systems for RPA to work. Bots enable enterprises to live the dream of\n  eliminating technology siloes by seamlessly connecting across all software\n  tools regardless of function and department, in both front office and back\n  office. The result? Achieve never-before seen enterprise-wide efficiencies and\n  collaboration that taps into the true value of your human capital investment.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Cost Savings & Fast ROI</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  The intuitive, code-free interface allows anyone to quickly master bot\n  creation and start driving ROI. For the average employee, that means regaining\n  40% of their time each day that was wasted on manual digital administrative\n  tasks. In industries like healthcare the value of automating is amplified by\n  the critical importance of error-free, compliant process execution to patient\n  outcomes.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Harness Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  When artificial intelligence (AI) is combined with RPA to create Intelligent\n  Automation, automating extends by an order of magnitude, able to draw on the\n  80% of enterprise data that’s unstructured.

LiDARs can accurately detect objects,\n  but they do not have the range or affordability of cameras or radar.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Sensor fusion brings the data from each of these sensor types together, using\n  software algorithms to provide the most comprehensive and therefore accurate,\n  environmental model possible. It can also correlate data pulled from inside\n  the cabin, through a process known as interior and exterior sensor fusion.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  A vehicle could use sensor fusion to fuse information from multiple sensors of\n  the same type as well - for instance, radar. This improves perception by\n  taking advantage of partially overlapping fields of view. As multiple radars\n  observe the environment around a vehicle, more than one sensor will detect\n  objects at the same time. Interpreted through perception software, detections\n  from those multiple sensors can be overlapped or fused, increasing the\n  detection probability and reliability of objects around the vehicle and\n  yielding a more accurate and reliable representation of the environment.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  It goes without saying, the more sensors on a vehicle, the more challenging\n  fusion becomes, but also the more opportunity exists to improve performance.\n  The process can be done more efficiently while making use of a centralised\n  domain controller. Some of the benefits include:\n</p>\n<br /><b>1. Reduced sensor sizes</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  Not so long ago, the processing power to analyse sensor data to determine and\n  track objects has been packaged with the cameras or radars. With a centralised\n  domain controller present, sensor data can be collected from each sensor and\n  fused within, which will result in reduced sensor sizes as the sensors now\n  does not need to process the information that they collect.\n</p>\n<br /><b>2. Increased data sharing</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  With traditional systems, smart sensors process environmental inputs\n  independently, which means any decisions made when using the information are\n  only as good as what that individual sensor can see. Now, all the data coming\n  from the sensors is shared centrally, there is more opportunity for active\n  safety applications in the domain controller to make use of it. By applying\n  Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, useful information could be extracted that\n  would otherwise be discarded.\n</p>\n<br /><b>3. Reduced Latency</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  The domain controller does not have to wait for the sensor to process data\n  before acting upon it. This could help in increased speed in response and thus\n  reduced latency. This will be a huge advantage in situations where even a\n  fraction of a second matters.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n<h2>By embracing a vehicle architecture that allows for a high number of sensors\n  and then synthesizes the data through sensor fusion, vehicles can become\n  smarter, faster.</h2>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to\n  the author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation,\n  committee or other group or individual.\n</p>\n<br /><br /><br />\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/Sensor Fusion","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-10-08T18:38:04.815Z","updatedAt":"2023-10-08T18:38:04.815Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1696790354801},"$loki":46},{"slug":"Serverless Computing and the Future","name":"Serverless Computing and the Future","titleImage":"260823/title","briefdesc":"Serverless computing and its various possibilities","postDate":"August 26, 2023","blogNumber":56,"toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"\n    Serverless computing revolutionizes software development with scalability and cost-efficiency, despite challenges\n    like cold starts and vendor lock-in.

Shaders are used when\n  detailing shadows, lighting, texture gradients and more. However, they can do\n  a lot more than just their namesake. You can often see shaders being packaged\n  as mods for games, transforming the dull, pixelated games into stunning,\n  sun-soaked landscapes.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Shader is a set of instructions that runs on the GPU (Graphics Processing\n  Unit). GPU is a processing unit or a circuit, specially designed for faster\n  and efficient computer graphics operation or image manipulation.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Shaders are categorised based on their functionality.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Vertex Shader</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  Vertex shader transforms each vertex's 3D position in virtual space to the 2D\n  coordinate at which it appears on the screen (as well as a depth value for the\n  Z-buffer). Vertex shaders can manipulate properties such as position, colour\n  and texture coordinates, but cannot create new vertices. The output of the\n  vertex shader goes to the next stage in the pipeline, which is either a\n  geometry shader if present, or the rasterizer. Vertex shaders can enable\n  powerful control over the details of position, movement, lighting, and colour\n  in any scene involving 3D models.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Pixel Shader</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  Pixel shaders, also known as fragment shaders, compute colour and other\n  attributes of each \"fragment\"- a unit of rendering work affecting at most a\n  single output pixel. The simplest kinds of pixel shaders output one screen\n  pixel as a colour value. More complex shaders with multiple inputs/outputs are\n  also possible. Pixel shaders range from simply always outputting the same\n  colour, to applying a lighting value, to doing bump mapping, shadows, specular\n  highlights, translucency and other phenomena.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Tessellation Shader</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  As of OpenGL 4.0 and Direct3D 11, a new shader class called a tessellation\n  shader has been added. It adds two new shader stages to the traditional model-\n  tessellation control shaders (also known as hull shaders) and tessellation\n  evaluation shaders (also known as Domain Shaders), which together allow for\n  simpler meshes to be subdivided into finer meshes at run-time according to a\n  mathematical function. The function can be related to a variety of variables,\n  most notably the distance from the viewing camera to allow active\n  level-of-detail scaling. This allows objects close to the camera to have fine\n  detail, while further away ones can have coarser meshes, yet seem comparable\n  in quality. It also can drastically reduce required mesh bandwidth by allowing\n  meshes to be refined once inside the shader units instead of down-sampling\n  very complex ones from memory.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Geometry Shader</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  The geometry shader is responsible for the creation of new rendering\n  primitives parting from the output of the vertex shader. A geometry shader is\n  executed once per primitive, which is, in the worst case (when it is used to\n  emit point primitives), the same as the vertex shader. The best-case scenario\n  is when it is used to emit triangles, because only then will it be executed\n  three times less than the vertex shader, but this complexity is relative.\n  Although the geometry shader's execution could be cheap, it always increases\n  the scene's complexity, and that always translates into more computational\n  time spent by the GPU to render the scene.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Compute Shader</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  The compute shader is a general-purpose shader that is used outside of a\n  rendering pipeline.

While they are an inherent part of software development, understanding the psychology behind them can\n    help us prevent, identify and squash them more effectively. In this article, we will delve into the psychology of\n    software bugs, exploring the cognitive biases and psychological factors that contribute to their creation and\n    providing strategies for their prevention.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>The Cognitive Biases at Play </b><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br /><b>Confirmation Bias</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n    Developers often interpret code in ways that confirm their preconceived notions. This can lead to overlooking errors\n    because they believe the code is correct.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Anchoring Bias</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n    Once a developer has a particular belief about the code, they may anchor to that belief and ignore evidence to the\n    contrary, making it challenging to spot bugs.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Availability Heuristic</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n    The more recent and memorable a bug or error is, the more likely developers are to think that it's a common problem,\n    even if it's a rare occurrence.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Overconfidence Bias</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n    Developers may overestimate their own abilities, assuming that they couldn't possibly have made a mistake in their\n    code.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Psychological Factors in Bug Creation</b><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br /><b>Fatigue and Burnout</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n    Tired developers are more prone to making errors. Recognizing this, it's essential to manage workloads and encourage\n    breaks.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Time Pressure</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n    Rushed coding often leads to shortcuts and errors. Creating a culture that values quality over speed can mitigate\n    this issue.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Complexity Overload</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n    When code becomes overly complex, it's harder to spot mistakes. Simplifying code and breaking it into manageable\n    chunks can help.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>Lack of Testing</b><br />\n<br />\n<p>\n    Insufficient testing can result from the belief that the code is bug-free.

This\n  will help the driver see the directions without having to look down at a GPS\n  panel on the dashboard. Motorists can be alerted to hazards, providing\n  directions and given warnings about traffic. On a more whimsical note, systems\n  can also provide drivers and passengers with information about nearby\n  landmarks and destinations. Of course, this is just scratching the surface of\n  the possibilities with which AR can revolutionize the Automotive Industry.\n  Designing, Planning, Testing, Quality Assurance, etc. are some of the areas\n  that could easily adopt the benefits and it surely doesn't stop there.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>2.

With the unveiling of ARKit 2.0 at WWDC 2018 and ARKit\n  3.0 at WWDC 2019, Apple seems to have an upper hand in the market.

But, the launch of the Unity engine surely\n  turned the tables. The powerful cross-platform engine enabled the game app\n  development for more than 25 platforms and distinct devices in a user-friendly\n  development environment. It provides a plethora of resources containing\n  ready-made assets, clear documentation, tutorials, intuitive tools and online\n  community at free to create amazing content.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Scripting, rendering, asset tracking and physics are some of the features of\n  Unity 3D that reduce the time and cost of development. It offers flexibility\n  to deploy projects on multiple platforms.

They serve the needs of various industries. Of the top of my mind the\n  top three would be Game development, Architecture and the Automotive industry.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  The game engines are widely used by the industry leaders in automotive\n  industry to run simulations and test scenarios - with the current situation,\n  we all are going through, the virtual world does have it advantages.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  So, here is what I think that are the reasons for someone to consider to\n  choose Unity 3D for their particular set of requirements.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br /><b>1.

There are a lot to go still on\n  regulations and approvals and then finally testing on road. In case of VTD,\n  you only need to create a base model and then make variations accordingly in\n  order to test it on virtual environments. You will still have to test it\n  physically on the road though. But now, the algorithm would have learned so\n  much from the virtual environments before it even hits the road.

Creating\n  this system might also take up a lot more memory but will save hours of\n  development and that is a just trade-off.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  You might also have noticed that most of the games have objects, characters\n  and enemies. So better to create a system that can handle any game rather than\n  create the same thing over and over again. Enter game engines. Frameworks that\n  provides the tools and structure required for almost every game to function.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Today, the games can handle high complexities with much ease. But this was not\n  the case not so long ago. Memory was so limited and precious. Even 512KB was a\n  luxury.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>A game engine usually contains five components.</p>\n<br />\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside\">\n  <li>Game logic.</li>\n  <li>Rendering engine - to generate 3D animated graphics.</li>\n  <li>Audio engine – with algorithms related to sounds.</li>\n  <li>Physics engine- to implement the physical laws and</li>\n  <li>Artificial Intelligence.</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><br />\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/210920/newGames.jpg\" alt=\"New Games\" />\n<br />\n<br />\n<p>\n  Third-party game engines became popular since the rise for the demand of 3D\n  games. Studios started to use them in order to speed up the development\n  process. But still most companies prefer cooking up their own game engines.\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n  Third-party game engines will save you a lot of time in development while\n  in-house game engines will help you achieve better optimization. Obvious\n  choices as third -party game engines would have been Unreal Engine and Unity\n  3D for a long time.
