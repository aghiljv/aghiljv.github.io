Working from\r\n    home, masks and lock-downs have taken a toll, to say the least.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>But, eventually we all had to come out of the shock and rearrange our lives to the new normal. On the other hand, we\r\n    also had time, to find new hobbies, embrace existing ones, learn something new, etc. My method of coping primarily\r\n    involved writing articles, reading the books that I never thought I had time to before and learning some new\r\n    technologies.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Writing Articles. Sort of...</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>On April 6, 2020, after the start of lock-down in India, I published my first article on LinkedIn. Then another on\r\n    the next week and then another and so on, which of course lead to the 52 (53 including this one) articles in the\r\n    end.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>To be honest, I thought, I may drop this one article per week like any other \"new year resolution\" and just move on.\r\n    But somehow, I did not. My team, especially my manager, was one of the reason I had started this and went on.\r\n    Without the feedback and encouragement from them, my friends and my LinkedIn network, this would not have been\r\n    possible.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>I think, going forward, even if the frequency of publishing articles might get reduced, I am not planning to stop.\r\n    Granted, these articles were mostly comprised of content from other articles, blogs and YouTube videos, I had to do\r\n    little research on most of these topics. But, by doing this and engaging myself, I was guaranteed to learn something\r\n    new every single week.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>At first, it was very easy to find the topics for the articles. But I too faced the \"writer's block\" - if I may be so\r\n    bold to call myself a writer, even though there there were plenty of topics - old and new, to write about. But\r\n    somehow, every week, I turned up with a topic resulting from random web browsing or conversation with my friends.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Building a personal website.</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Even before all of this, I was working on building myself an online portfolio. After all, I am a software developer,\r\n    who happens to know how to build a website and have worked on several. This would be a testimony of my ability to do\r\n    the same.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>I would be lying if I said I had done it all by myself. So many people helped me create and modify the design,\r\n    choosing the technologies to build, where to host etc. I used GitHub Pages and Heroku at first and eventually, as\r\n    per suggestion from most of my friends and I decided to buy a domain. I did get help in choosing the best possible\r\n    option for that as well.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>And just like that <a href=\"https://aghiljose.com\" style=\"color: var(--primary-color)\" target=\"_blank\"\r\n        rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AghilJose.com</a> came to existence and my <a href=\"https://aghiljose.com/blog\"\r\n        style=\"color: var(--primary-color)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">personal blog</a> - which has all\r\n    the articles that I publish here on LinkedIn.</p>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<picture>\r\n    <source srcset=\"/img/blog/060421/site.webp\" type=\"image/webp\" />\r\n    <img style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain\" src=\"/img/blog/060421/site.jpg\" alt=\"Site Screenshot\" />\r\n</picture>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Assembling a custom PC.</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>I have had used many desktops and laptops in the past, but not once anything with the components which I have chosen\r\n    and built from scratch.

By adding unit tests, failures can be\r\n  detected early on, pretty much as soon as the code is written and the team\r\n  would be able to take care of any unintended defect without any complications.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>2. Improve Code Design</b> <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  When you consider implementing unit testing, you have to make sure that your\r\n  code is testable. Think about it, when you deal with the overall design\r\n  concept, and you need break down the high-level design to ‘single\r\n  entity-multiple components’, you’ll be forced to think of each unit and make\r\n  sure each of them is testable. This improves the overall code design by clear\r\n  unit separation, defining better unit interfaces and the design concept.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>3. Improves Teamwork</b> <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Along with the documentation, it improves teamwork. Your colleagues can review\r\n  the logic behind your code and coordinate their code accordingly. Being able\r\n  to review each other’s code, the teamwork is more cohesive and Agile.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>4. Inspires Confidence</b> <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  You develop software and then you write tests to examine if it works. You will\r\n  be able to validate in the early stages whether your code is actually\r\n  functional. Once your tests are passed, you feel confident knowing that your\r\n  software is in good shape. Many issues could be avoided this way - not\r\n  everything.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>5. Easier Changes and Refactoring of Code</b> <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Automated unit tests catches bugs easily and knowing that makes you feel more\r\n  confident. Once an issue is detected, you feel more at ease when you have to\r\n  make changes to your code, even if the changes are beyond trivial ones – any\r\n  code issue detected before it’s released to production is a victory!\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <h2\r\n    >We as developers hesitate to add unit testing to our work routine. Some\r\n    refuse to do so because writing extra code adds more time and effort to an\r\n    already busy day. What is often not considered is that going the extra mile\r\n    may save time in the long run. Eliminating unit testing is only time-saving\r\n    if your code is going to work bug free.</h2\r\n  >\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to the\r\n  author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation, committee\r\n  or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/5 Things to motivate you to perform Unit Testing","extension":".md","createdAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.604Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.604Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1671873476986},"$loki":3},{"slug":"5 Mistakes Front-end Developers should Avoid","name":"5 Mistakes Front-end Developers should Avoid","titleImage":"200420/frontMistake","briefdesc":"An article regarding usual mistakes made by most Front-end Developers/Engineers.","postDate":"April 20, 2020","blogNumber":3,"toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"A front-end developer could easily avoid these common mistakes and ensure\n    that their site is easy to use and loads fast.

Increases Confidence in the Application</b> <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  End-to-end testing also increases the confidence in the functioning and\r\n  performance of the application before its release as the application is tested\r\n  across different endpoints for&nbsp;different devices and\r\n  platforms&nbsp;comprehensively.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<b>5. Reduces Costs &amp; Time</b> <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  End-to-end testing via&nbsp;automation testing tool&nbsp;reduces errors\r\n  recurrence, which means the application doesn’t require undergoing repeated\r\n  testing. This considerably reduces the testing costs and time and helps\r\n  achieve better productivity in other significant processes.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <h2\r\n    >End-to-end testing is a must to test and scale the application across a\r\n    range of different systems, devices, layers, servers, database interactions,\r\n    APIs and communication.&nbsp;Further, automating end-to-end testing allows\r\n    you to quickly respond to changing business needs and adds greater agility\r\n    to the entire testing project.</h2\r\n  >\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Tools of my choice are:</b> <br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside\">\r\n  <li>Selenium</li>\r\n  <li>Cypress</li>\r\n  <li>Nightwatch</li>\r\n  <li>Karma</li>\r\n  <li>Jasmine</li>\r\n  <li>Jest</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to the\r\n  author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation, committee\r\n  or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/5 Essential Reasons for E2E Testing","extension":".md","createdAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.603Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.604Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1671873476996},"$loki":5},{"slug":"6 Levels of Autonomous Vehicles","name":"6 Levels of Autonomous Vehicles","titleImage":"150620/adLevelTitle","briefdesc":"An article describing the levels involved in autonomous driving.","postDate":"June 15, 2020","blogNumber":11,"toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"Due to regulations, legal battles and the technology Level 5 vehicles are\n    probably still many years away."}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n  The ideas and experimentations for self-driving cars has been going on since\n  the 1920s.

The role of ADAS is to prevent\r\n  deaths and injuries by reducing the number of car accidents and the serious\r\n  impact of those that cannot be avoided.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Autonomous application solutions are partitioned into various chips, called\r\n  SoCs (systems on a chip). These chips connect sensors to actuators through\r\n  interfaces and high-performance ECUs (electronic controller units).\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Self-driving cars use a variety of these applications and technologies to gain\r\n  360-degree vision, both near (in the vehicle’s immediate vicinity) and far.\r\n  That means hardware designs are using more advanced process nodes to meet\r\n  ever-higher performance targets while simultaneously reducing demands on power\r\n  and footprint.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Some of the most common ADAS applications are:\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>1. Adaptive Cruise Control</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Adaptive cruise control (ACC) is particularly helpful on the highway, where\r\n  drivers can find it difficult to monitor their speed and other cars over a\r\n  long period of time. Advanced cruise control can automatically accelerate,\r\n  slow down, and at times stop the vehicle, depending on the actions other\r\n  objects in the immediate area.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>2. Glare-Free High Beam and Pixel Light</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Glare-free high beam and pixel light uses sensors to adjust to darkness and\r\n  the vehicle’s surroundings without disturbing oncoming traffic. This new\r\n  headlight application detects the lights of other vehicles and redirects the\r\n  vehicle’s lights away to prevent other road users from being temporarily\r\n  blinded.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>3. Adaptive Light Control</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Adaptive light control adapts the vehicle’s headlights to external lighting\r\n  conditions. It changes the strength, direction, and rotation of the headlights\r\n  depending on the vehicle’s environment and darkness.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>4. Automatic Parking </b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Automatic parking helps inform drivers of blind spots so they know when to\r\n  turn the steering wheel and stop. Vehicles equipped with rearview cameras have\r\n  a better view of their surroundings than traditional side mirrors. Some\r\n  systems can even complete parking automatically without the driver’s help by\r\n  combining the input of multiple sensors.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b> 5. Autonomous Valet Parking</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Autonomous valet parking is a new technology that works via vehicle sensor\r\n  meshing, 5G network communication, with cloud services that manage autonomous\r\n  vehicles in parking areas. The vehicles sensors provide the vehicle with\r\n  information about where it is, where it needs to go, and how to get there\r\n  safely. All this information is methodically evaluated and used to perform\r\n  drive acceleration, braking, and steering until the vehicle is safely parked.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>6. Navigation System</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Car navigation systems provide on-screen instructions and voice prompts to\r\n  help drivers follow a route while concentrating on the road. Some navigation\r\n  systems can display exact traffic data and, if necessary, plan a new route to\r\n  avoid traffic jams. Advanced systems may even offer Heads Up Displays (HuD) to\r\n  reduce driver distraction.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>7. Night Vision</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Night vision systems enable drivers to see things that would otherwise be\r\n  difficult or impossible to see at night. There are two categories of night\r\n  vision implementations: Active night vision systems project infrared light,\r\n  and passive systems rely on the thermal energy that comes from cars, animals,\r\n  and other objects.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>8. Blind Spot Monitoring</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Blind spot detection systems use sensors to provide drivers with important\r\n  information that is otherwise difficult or impossible to obtain. Some systems\r\n  sound an alarm when they detect an object in the driver’s blind spot, such as\r\n  when the driver tries to move into an occupied lane.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>9. Automatic Emergency Braking</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Automatic emergency braking uses sensors to detect whether the driver is in\r\n  the process of hitting another vehicle or other objects on the road. This\r\n  application can measure the distance of nearby traffic and alert the driver to\r\n  any danger. Some emergency braking systems can take preventive safety\r\n  measures, such as tightening seat belts, reducing speed, and adaptive steering\r\n  to avoid a collision.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>10. Crosswind Stabilization</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  This relatively new ADAS feature supports the vehicle in counteracting strong\r\n  crosswinds. The sensors in this system can detect strong pressure acting on\r\n  the vehicle while driving and apply brakes to the wheels affected by crosswind\r\n  disturbance.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>11. Driver Drowsiness Detection</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Driver drowsiness detection warns drivers of sleepiness or other road\r\n  distractions. There are several ways to determine whether a driver’s attention\r\n  is decreasing. In one case, sensors can analyze the movement of the driver’s\r\n  head, and heart rate to determine whether they indicate drowsiness. Other\r\n  systems issue driver alerts similar to the warning signals for lane detection.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>12. Driver Monitoring System</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The driver monitoring system is another way of measuring the driver’s\r\n  attention. The camera sensors can analyze whether the driver’s eyes are on the\r\n  road or drifting. Driver monitoring systems can alert drivers with noises,\r\n  vibrations in the steering wheel, or flashing lights. In some cases, the car\r\n  will take the extreme measure of stopping the vehicle completely.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n<h2>Automobiles are the foundation of the next generation of mobile-connected\r\n  devices, with rapid advances being made in autonomous vehicles.</h2>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to\r\n  the author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation,\r\n  committee or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/ADAS","extension":".md","createdAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.605Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.605Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1671873477018},"$loki":7},{"slug":"Best 5 Hybrid Mobile App Development Frameworks","name":"Best 5 Hybrid Mobile App Development Frameworks","titleImage":"080620/hybridTitle","briefdesc":"An article regarding the prominent hybrid mobile application development tools.","postDate":"June 08, 2020","blogNumber":10,"toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"To make the right choice, you should analyse your needs, draft an image of\n    your end product, and select the most suitable technology stack."}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n  Nowadays, people require valuable business information at their fingertips.\n  The number of companies that enter into the mobile applications rather than\n  just to go with a desktop website is increasing day by day.

If the fingerprint of a\r\n  block changes, it no longer is the same block.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The third element inside each block is the hash of the previous block. This\r\n  effectively creates a chain of blocks and it’s this technique that makes a\r\n  blockchain so secure.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Let's take an example. Let’s assume, we have a chain of 3 blocks. Each block\r\n  has a hash and the hash of the previous block. So, block number 3 points to\r\n  block number 2 and number 2 points to number 1. Now the first block is a bit\r\n  special, it cannot point to previous blocks because it's the first one. We\r\n  call this the genesis block. Now let's say that you tamper with the second\r\n  block. This causes the hash of the block to change as well. In turn that will\r\n  make block 3 and all following blocks invalid because they no longer store a\r\n  valid hash of the previous block. So, changing a single block will make all\r\n  following blocks invalid.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  But using hashes is not enough to prevent tampering. Computers these days are\r\n  very fast and can calculate hundreds of thousands of hashes per second. You\r\n  could effectively tamper with a block and recalculate all the hashes of other\r\n  blocks to make your blockchain valid again. So, to mitigate this, blockchains\r\n  have something called proof-of-work. It's a mechanism that slows down the\r\n  creation of new blocks. In Bitcoins case: it takes about 10 minutes to\r\n  calculate the required proof-of-work and add a new block to the chain. This\r\n  mechanism makes it very hard to tamper with the blocks, because if you tamper\r\n  with 1 block, you'll need to recalculate the proof-of-work for all the\r\n  following blocks.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  So, the security of a blockchain comes from its creative use of hashing and\r\n  the proof-of-work mechanism. But there is one more way that blockchains secure\r\n  themselves and that's by being distributed.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Instead of using a central entity to manage the chain, blockchains use a\r\n  peer-to-peer network and anyone is allowed to join. When someone joins this\r\n  network, he gets the full copy of the blockchain. The node can use this to\r\n  verify that everything is still in order. Now let's see what happens when\r\n  someone creates a new block. That new block is send to everyone on the\r\n  network. Each node then verifies the block to make sure that it hasn't been\r\n  tampered with. If everything checks out, each node adds this block to their\r\n  own blockchain. All the nodes in this network create consensus. They agree\r\n  about what blocks are valid and which aren't. Blocks that are tampered with\r\n  will be rejected by other nodes in the network. So, to successfully tamper\r\n  with a blockchain you'll need to tamper with all blocks on the chain, redo the\r\n  proof-of-work for each block and take control of more than 50% of the\r\n  peer-to-peer network. Only then will your tampered block become accepted by\r\n  everyone else. This is almost impossible to do!\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Blockchains are also constantly evolving. One of the more recent developments\r\n  is the creation of smart contracts. These contracts are simple programs that\r\n  are stored on the blockchain and can be used to automatically exchange coins\r\n  based on certain conditions.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The creation of blockchain technology peaked a lot of people’s interest. Soon,\r\n  others realized that the technology could be used for other things like\r\n  storing medical records, creating a digital notary or even collecting taxes.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to\r\n  the author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation,\r\n  committee or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/Blockchains - How and Why","extension":".md","createdAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.606Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.606Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1671873477040},"$loki":10},{"slug":"Brain Computer Interfaces","name":"Brain Computer Interfaces","titleImage":"141220/title","briefdesc":"A little about BCI's and its current state of affairs.","postDate":"December 13, 2020","blogNumber":37,"toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"It is clear that BCI's are rising and in the future, this could lead to some\n  kind of cyborg fusion between human beings and machines."}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n  Back in the early days of computing, data input was done using punch cards or\n  switches or reels of rapidly moving paper tape.

The boom in this area has led to the mushrooming of both\r\n  web-based and in-class training centers, which help individuals become full\r\n  stack engineers. Some of these centers also support trainees to get plum\r\n  coding jobs at the end of the course.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>Who is a full stack engineer?</b></p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  A programmer skilled in coding both the frontend and the backend parts of a\r\n  web application is called a full stack web engineer.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>The frontend:</b> This is the part of the web application that the user\r\n  sees and uses.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>The backend:</b> These are parts of the application that function behind\r\n  the scenes and execute the commands issued by the user. This usually includes:\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside\">\r\n  <li>logical processes</li>\r\n  <li>database-related processes</li>\r\n  <li>validation of users</li>\r\n  <li>server configuration</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  A full stack engineer is not expected to be an expert in all areas pertaining\r\n  to the frontends and backends. The individual needs to be knowledgeable in all\r\n  the technologies involved and should be able to understand the processes\r\n  happening within the entire application.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  You can become a full stack engineer by following a few simple steps, such as:\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>1. Learn the necessary programming languages</b><br /><br />\r\n<p>A full stack engineer needs to know the following technologies:</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>HTML/CSS</b></p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The web is built on these technologies. HTML is the tool that helps engineers\r\n  input content into a website and CSS is a designing tool used to alter the\r\n  appearance of web applications. Both are essential tools for a full stack\r\n  engineer and are taught in all courses, whether online or in-person.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>JavaScript</b></p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  This is a must-have for any full stack engineer. This can be used in both\r\n  front-end and back-end processes. Browsers are built on it and JavaScript can\r\n  be used as a server-side language as well.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>Backend technologies</b></p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  After mastering HTML/CSS and JavaScript, you need to learn at least one\r\n  language used for coding backend processes. The functions occurring in the\r\n  backend of a web application are database operations, user validation, and\r\n  logical operations.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Any course, whether online or otherwise, most often will teach you backend\r\n  technology — PHP, Java, Python, or SQL. Learning one of the languages should\r\n  suffice but you should attain proficiency in it.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>2. Refine the knowledge</b><br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  To understand complex concepts, you need to be sure about the fundamentals.\r\n  JavaScript & HTML/CSS form the base of web development. For any novice, you\r\n  should be clear about all aspects of these technologies.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Knowledge of programming concepts can help improve coding skills. Some\r\n  theories/knowledge to acquire before pushing ahead are:\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside\">\r\n  <li>Servers and their functioning.</li>\r\n  <li>Networks and their nuances.</li>\r\n  <li>Web-hosting environments.</li>\r\n  <li>Algorithms and their formulation.</li>\r\n  <li>Data structures (types, properties, and use).</li>\r\n  <li>Programming technologies.</li>\r\n  <li>Databases and their management</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  You should be able to piece together the different parts of the application\r\n  and create a whole out of the parts. For this, you should understand how each\r\n  part works, its role in the bigger scheme of things and how one part connects\r\n  to the other.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>3. Become familiar with all technologies but a master of one</b\r\n><br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  As the scope of your leaning expands, you will realize that there is much more\r\n  to learn than you possibly can master. Most programmers fail because they try\r\n  to learn too much of too many things. There is no need for such efforts.\r\n  Master one and understand the rest. Learn how to work in them and that should\r\n  be good enough.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  As your experience grows, your ease with the technologies will also improve.\r\n  Take pains to specialize in one technology. Choose a technology popular among\r\n  clients. This should help you compete effectively with others in the field and\r\n  produce outstanding work. And with the way this economy is growing with lower\r\n  taxes, you should have a bright career ahead and be able to relocate other\r\n  states if you wish to.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>4. Get practical exposure</b><br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The most challenging part of the process is when you have a thorough\r\n  understanding of all the necessary technologies—HTML/CSS, JavaScript, back-end\r\n  programming, databases, and HTTP/REST. Time has come to use all this knowledge\r\n  in an application. For this, you need to know:\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside\">\r\n  <li>The right way to structure code.</li>\r\n  <li>Means to separate files.</li>\r\n  <li>Environment to host large media files.</li>\r\n  <li>The right data structures to use.</li>\r\n  <li>Location of each computational task (client-side or server-side).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Theoretical knowledge can be obtained by reading online materials, but to\r\n  understand application architecture properly, you must implement an actual web\r\n  application.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Working with a team is the ideal way to accomplish this through an individual\r\n  can also develop an application alone. This exercise adds the all-essential\r\n  practical exposure to the technology toolkit of a full-stack engineer.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  A few companies may insist on an applicant having a degree in computer science\r\n  to apply for the position, but most will overlook education if a candidate can\r\n  exhibit the necessary coding abilities.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>5. Take up additional assignments</b><br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Join additional projects in your company that work on technologies outside\r\n  your expertise. This way you will upskill and add extra value to your\r\n  organization as well. Most companies will appreciate these types of\r\n  initiatives — just don’t try to show anyone up and courteous in your pursuit\r\n  of learning.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to the\r\n  author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation, committee\r\n  or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/How to be a Full Stack Engineer","extension":".md","createdAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.608Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.608Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1671873477102},"$loki":20},{"slug":"How to be an effective Engineer","name":"How to be an effective Engineer?","titleImage":"280920/eeTitle","briefdesc":"The necessary skills needed for any software engineer.","postDate":"September 28, 2020","blogNumber":26,"toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"If we have these skills, we can learn new languages and tools much quicker\n  and create exceptional software."}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n  Every software engineer or developer might have asked this question to\n  themselves or to their colleagues at some point.

Not only does this help internal\r\n  operations, but through the use of the cloud environment where data is stored,\r\n  equipment and operations can be optimized by leveraging the insights of others\r\n  using the same equipment or to allow smaller enterprises access to technology\r\n  they wouldn’t be able to on their own.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>Digital Twins</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Since connected machines collect a tremendous volume of data that can inform\r\n  maintenance, performance and other issues, as well as analyse that data to\r\n  identify patterns and insights that would be impossible for a human to do in a\r\n  reasonable timeframe, Industry 4.0 offers the opportunity for manufacturers to\r\n  optimize their operations quickly and efficiently by knowing what needs\r\n  attention.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>Optimize logistics and supply chains</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  A connected supply chain can adjust and accommodate when new information is\r\n  presented. If a weather delay ties up a shipment, a connected system can\r\n  proactively adjust to that reality and modify manufacturing priorities.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>Robots</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Once only possible for large enterprises with equally large budgets, robotics\r\n  is now more affordable and available to organizations of every size. From\r\n  picking products at a warehouse to getting them ready to ship, autonomous\r\n  robots can quickly and safely support manufacturers. Robots move goods around\r\n  Amazon warehouses and also reduce costs and allow better use of floor space\r\n  for the online retailer.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>3D Printing</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  This technology has improved tremendously in the last decade and has\r\n  progressed from primarily being used for prototyping to actual production.\r\n  Advances in the use of metal additive manufacturing have opened up a lot of\r\n  possibilities for production.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to the\r\n  author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation, committee\r\n  or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/Industry 4","extension":".md","createdAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.609Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.609Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1671873477135},"$loki":24},{"slug":"Internet of Behaviours","name":"Internet of Behaviours","titleImage":"150321/title","briefdesc":"A sneak peek into the Internet of Behaviour.","postDate":"March 12, 2021","blogNumber":50,"toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"The IoT surely converts data to information.

It may be your phone. It may be a laptop, your TV, or\r\n  even your fridge.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Internet of things generally refers to the collection of all those devices.\r\n  But now, you can argue that anything that has the ability to connect to the\r\n  internet and collect and share data is a part of internet of things or IoT in\r\n  short.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Now the question here usually is what is IoT? Why do we need it? How does it\r\n  help us? How does it work and many more questions of the sort.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  So, what is IoT?\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  IoT refers to the collection of all those devices that have the ability to\r\n  connect to the internet and collect and share data. Hence the name internet of\r\n  things. So basically, we have a device that collects data from its\r\n  surroundings, using sensors and actuators and sends this collected data to the\r\n  internet where the processing of that data can happen.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  There are many devices that can be included in this classification. Examples\r\n  can be phones laptops, watches, refrigerators, washing machines, cars and even\r\n  homes.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Homes themselves can be a part of IoT too. Most IoT devices have the word\r\n  smart at the start of their names, smart phones, smart watches, smart TVs,\r\n  smart refrigerators and smart homes.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  So, why do we need IoT? How does it help us?\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  It helps makes our lives easier and more comfortable. If we take an example,\r\n  smartphones have more use cases than we can list here without going on for\r\n  hours. It can call, it allows us to watch movies. It allows us to connect to\r\n  the internet, interact with strangers, shop things.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  But let's take a better example for our understanding. Smart house. A smart\r\n  house has many different features that we can talk about. One of the features\r\n  is automatic lights, where the lights automatically detect your presence in\r\n  the room and get switched on. They can also be voice activated. You can say\r\n  activate and they'll get switched on. It may have next generation security to\r\n  keep your house safe. It might only allow authorized people to enter and locks\r\n  up everything when you leave. Then it has entertainment management, for using\r\n  devices, such as Google home, Amazon echo to keep track of your chores, to\r\n  play movies and songs, etc. It also keeps track of temperature management. The\r\n  house automatically adjusts the temperature based on the surrounding climate.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Now, this is at an individual level. At a larger scale, it benefits the\r\n  society as a whole. In industries such as healthcare, it has many use cases.\r\n  It allows for remote interaction between patients and doctors. So, if a\r\n  patient has any sort of a deadly disease, the doctor doesn't necessarily have\r\n  to come in close contact to help the patient out. Doctors make amazing\r\n  decisions and based on the time and the data they've been given. But computers\r\n  can sometimes make better decisions. Combining doctors and computers can give\r\n  us the best diagnosis possible.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Farming has been one of the industries that has stayed with us since the\r\n  beginning of human civilization itself. Right now, is the correct time to\r\n  improve upon our traditional methods and shift into modern farming to provide\r\n  food for our ever-growing population. Smart technologies have definitely\r\n  helped us increase the productivity. Through new devices like smart tractors\r\n  and analysis devices that will help us get a better data analysis of a soil.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Now the manufacturing industry has taken IoT with open arms. It already has\r\n  automation replacing many menial jobs. IoT did not only increase the\r\n  interactivity, but also boosted the efficiency and production as well.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  In education, better methods to teach children are already being implemented\r\n  that are in conjunction with IoT. A good example is Augmented Reality. Being\r\n  used in some classes to give students a better experience of real-life animals\r\n  and even extinct animals. So, having IoT will not only be beneficial to us\r\n  individually, but also be beneficial to us as a society.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  So, how does IoT work?\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  There are basically four layers to it.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The first layer is sensing/device layer which is basically the hardware part\r\n  of IoT. This is basically an embedded device. It has sensors and actuators\r\n  that collect the data from surroundings based on specific function. For\r\n  example, temperature sensors, atmospheric pressure sensors and light sensors.\r\n  They basically collect all the data and they give it to the embedded device.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Now after the data has been collected, it goes to the connectivity layer,\r\n  usually to the cloud, using the internet. This connection is generally made\r\n  through one of the methods like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, RFID or NFC.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  After that comes to data processing layer. Now the data, once it reaches the\r\n  cloud is subjected to data analysis. Different types of algorithms are used\r\n  based on the type of data collected to get meaningful insights and patterns.\r\n  Then a decision is made based on the insights. Once the processing is\r\n  complete, the result of the decision is conveyed to the IoT device and changes\r\n  are made.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  User Interface/Application Layer, is the last layer. It's basically the\r\n  front-end to all the back-end processing, which are included the previous\r\n  levels. Now a good example to explain this process would be a smart fridge.\r\n  The sensors in the smart fridge collect data from the surrounding. They see\r\n  what the temperature is and what kind of item is being stored inside the\r\n  fridge. Once it collects all of this data, it sends it to a central cloud\r\n  where the processing happens based on this collected data. The system decides\r\n  whether to keep the temperature or to change it and we can see the result of\r\n  this on the interactive screen of the fridge.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n<h2>It would not be crazy to see that we may live in a future, like how it is\r\n  depicted in sci-fi movies. A future in which everything we use is connected to\r\n  the internet, where it interacts with a central cloud, where all of our data\r\n  is being collected and being utilized to make our lives and our society a much\r\n  better place.</h2>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to\r\n  the author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation,\r\n  committee or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/Internet of Things","extension":".md","createdAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.609Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.609Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1671873477149},"$loki":26},{"slug":"LiDAR","name":"LiDAR","titleImage":"180121/title","briefdesc":"Light Detection and Ranging - Possibilities.","postDate":"January 17, 2021","blogNumber":42,"toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"LiDAR on ADAS will ultimately guide our journey in delivering a true\n  fully-autonomous vehicle, without compromising safety.\n"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n  LiDAR, or light detection and ranging, is a popular remote sensing method used\n  for measuring the exact distance of an object on the earth’s surface.

These 5 principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), in\r\n  a paper Design Principles and Design Patterns in 2000. The actual SOLID\r\n  acronym was, however, identified later by Michael Feathers. The intention of\r\n  these principles is to make software designs more understandable, easier to\r\n  maintain and easier to extend. As a software engineer, these 5 principles are\r\n  essential to know!\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>S — Single responsibility principle</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  In programming, the Single Responsibility Principle states that every module\r\n  or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality\r\n  provided by the software. You may have heard the quote: “Do one thing and do\r\n  it well”. This refers to the single responsibility principle. In the article\r\n  Principles of Object Oriented Design, Robert C. Martin defines a\r\n  responsibility as a ‘reason to change’, and concludes that a class or module\r\n  should have one, and only one, reason to be changed.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>O — Open/closed principle</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  In programming, the open/closed principle states that software entities\r\n  (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extensions, but closed\r\n  for modification. If you have a general understanding of OOP, you probably\r\n  already know about polymorphism. We can make sure that our code is compliant\r\n  with the open/closed principle by utilizing inheritance and/or implementing\r\n  interfaces that enable classes to polymorphically substitute for each other.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>L — Liskov substitution principle</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  This one is probably the hardest one to wrap your head around when being\r\n  introduced for the first time. In programming, the Liskov substitution\r\n  principle states that if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be\r\n  replaced (or substituted) with objects of type S. This can be formulated\r\n  mathematically as\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Let ϕ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T.</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Then ϕ(y) should be true for objects y of type S, where S is a subtype of T.\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  More generally it states that objects in a program should be replaceable with\r\n  instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>I — Interface segregation principle</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  This principle is fairly easy to comprehend. In fact, if you’re used to using\r\n  interfaces, chances are that you’re already applying this principle. If not,\r\n  it’s time to start doing it!

This principle states that\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside\">\r\n  <li>\r\n    High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.

Point clouds allow technology to interpret and represent 3D\r\n  spaces through 3D digital images.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  So, what is a point cloud?\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  A point cloud is a collection of data points defined by a given coordinates\r\n  system. In a 3D coordinates system, for example, a point cloud may define the\r\n  shape of some real or created physical system. Point clouds are used to create\r\n  3D meshes and other models used in 3D modelling for various fields including\r\n  medical imaging, architecture, 3D printing, manufacturing, 3D gaming and\r\n  various virtual reality (VR) applications.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  As the world’s gone digital, so too has technology, being used ever more in\r\n  construction and planning projects. 3D images representing real-world objects,\r\n  landscapes and spaces are being generated by software and displayed digitally.\r\n  But for these images to be created, we first need to be able to read and\r\n  identify their dimensions. That’s where point cloud data comes in.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Point clouds are a series of different “points”, similar to pixels in a\r\n  digital picture. Each pixel is made up of two coordinates – X and Y, while a\r\n  LiDAR point is made up of three coordinates — X, Y and Z — which refers to a\r\n  specific position in a three-dimensional space.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Point clouds can be created in the following ways.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>LiDAR</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology uses light to measure distances\r\n  and dimensions. Time of flight LiDAR (the most popular method) works by\r\n  sending a pulse of light from a laser. Each pulse is measured and added to the\r\n  point cloud. Once the entire space or landscape has been measured, the point\r\n  cloud can be used to create a 3D map or CAD model.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Photogrammetry</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Point clouds can also be collected using photogrammetry, which uses multiple\r\n  photos, taken from various angles, to calculate points. Photogrammetric point\r\n  clouds give each point an RGB value, which then creates a colorized point\r\n  cloud.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Both photogrammetry and LiDAR point cloud generating systems are popular.\r\n  Typically, photogrammetry systems are cheaper, but LiDAR systems are much more\r\n  accurate. The correct choice depends on the application of your project.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Point cloud data can be used to bring coordinates to life in the form of a 3D\r\n  CAD (Computer-Aided Design) image.

But\r\n  most of them could be avoided if we implement the so called good practices\r\n  into the software development life-cycle.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>1. Accurate understanding of end-user needs</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img\r\n  style=\"width: 100%\"\r\n  src=\"/img/blog/020920/userNeeds.jpg\"\r\n  alt=\"Accurate understanding of end-user needs\"\r\n/>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  No matter you are making software as a product or for a client, you have to\r\n  have a clear understanding of the end-user needs. Significant man hours have\r\n  gone to waste and so have many applications built during it just by failing to\r\n  understand the same. The end-user or client needs cannot usually be determined\r\n  by one single meeting. It requires good research and understanding the problem\r\n  statement first-hand. Then and only then we could try and solve the problem\r\n  more efficiently.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>2.

Sure, you could actually make the software\r\n  development process much faster, but usually at the expense of compromising\r\n  some vital steps. The applications developed skipping these “non-essential\r\n  steps” might sooner or later become a big problem. It might be true that you\r\n  could save the time and resources while building it in the first place. But,\r\n  when (not if) it comes back with bugs, it will cost you more of both.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>3. Refactor</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/020920/refactor.jpg\" alt=\"Refactor\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  There is usually the need to upgrade and maintain a software as time goes on.\r\n  Whenever you see the need and have the chance do not hesitate to refactor the\r\n  code. Refactoring will usually help create a code base with increased\r\n  readability, smooth execution, less bugs and higher performance.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>4.

But this\r\n  process is about to meet its physical limits. Computer parts are approaching\r\n  the size of an atom. To understand why this is a problem, we have to clear up\r\n  some basics.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  A computer is made up of very simple components doing very simple things.\r\n  Representing data, the means of processing it, and control mechanisms.\r\n  Computer chips contain modules, which contain logic gates, which contain\r\n  transistors.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  A transistor is the simplest form of a data processor in computers, basically\r\n  a switch that can either block, or open the way for information coming\r\n  through. This information is made up of bits which can be set to either 0 or\r\n  1. Combinations of several bits are used to represent more complex\r\n  information. Transistors are combined to create logic gates which still do\r\n  very simple stuff. For example, an AND Gate sends an output of 1 if all of its\r\n  inputs are 1, and an output of 0 otherwise.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Combinations of logic gates finally form meaningful modules, say, for adding\r\n  two numbers. Once you can add, you can also multiply, and once you can\r\n  multiply, you can basically do anything. Since all basic operations are\r\n  literally simpler than first grade math.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  However, with parts getting tinier and tinier, quantum physics are making\r\n  things tricky. In a nutshell, a transistor is just an electric switch.\r\n  Electricity is electrons moving from one place to another. So, a switch is a\r\n  passage that can block electrons from moving in one direction.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Today, a typical scale for transistors is 14 nanometres, which is about 8\r\n  times less than the HIV virus' diameter and 500 times smaller than a red blood\r\n  cell.

A quantum computer could quickly\r\n  crack current public-key cryptography.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Companies and governments around the world are in a quantum arms race, the\r\n  race to build the first usable quantum computer. The technology promises to\r\n  make some kinds of computing problems much easier to solve than with today’s\r\n  classical computers.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  One of those problems is breaking certain types of encryption, particularly\r\n  the methods used in today’s Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which underlies\r\n  practically all of today’s online communications. Instead of solving one\r\n  problem at a time, with quantum computing we can solve thousands of problems\r\n  at the same processing speed, with the same processing power. Things that\r\n  would take hundreds of days today could take just hours on a quantum computer.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The commercial quantum computers available today are still far from being able\r\n  to do that. The theories have advanced farther than the hardware. However, we\r\n  shouldn’t wait for the hardware to motivate the switch to post-quantum\r\n  cryptography.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Longer keys are the first line of defence against quantum encryption and\r\n  pretty much everybody is on board with that. Longer keys make encryption\r\n  slower and more costly and the key length will have to increase substantially\r\n  to stay ahead of quantum computers.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Another option is to use symmetric encryption for the messages themselves,\r\n  then use asymmetric encryption just for the keys. This is the idea behind the\r\n  Transport Layer Security (TLS) online standard.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Many researchers are also looking at ways to create new kinds of encryption\r\n  algorithms that would still allow public and private keys but be proof against\r\n  quantum computers. For example, it’s easy to multiply two prime numbers\r\n  together but very difficult to break a large number back up into its prime\r\n  factors. Quantum computers can do it and there are already known quantum\r\n  techniques that could solve the factoring problem and many similar approaches.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  However, there’s no known quantum method to crack lattice-based encryption,\r\n  which uses cryptographic algorithms built around lattices. Lattice\r\n  cryptography is the one that looks to be the favourite at the moment, simply\r\n  because it’s the most practical to implement.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The best solution could be a combination of post-quantum algorithms like\r\n  lattice-based encryption for the initial communication to securely exchange\r\n  keys, then using symmetric encryption for the main messages.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Can we really rely on lattice-based encryption or similar algorithms to be\r\n  safe? You can’t guarantee that your post-quantum algorithm will be secure\r\n  against a future quantum computer that uses some unknown quantum algorithm.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  This is where the laws of quantum physics can come to the rescue. Quantum key\r\n  distribution (QKD) is a method of sending encryption keys using some very\r\n  peculiar behaviours of subatomic particles that is, in theory at least,\r\n  completely unhackable. The land-based version of QKD is a system where photons\r\n  are sent one at a time through a fibreoptic line. If anyone is eavesdropping,\r\n  then, according to the principles of quantum physics, the polarization of the\r\n  photons is affected, and the recipient can tell that the message isn’t secure.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  However, the technology is extremely slow and requires expensive equipment to\r\n  send and receive the individual photons. A customer would need to buy a\r\n  transmitter and a receiver - both very costly as of now. It’s not too terribly\r\n  different from other high-speed fibre optics communication equipment and the\r\n  price will come down over time as more companies provide the hardware.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The big breakthrough last year was that QKD systems no longer require special\r\n  pipes. Now it looks like they’ll be able to use existing fibre networks, so\r\n  they don’t have to lay new fibre.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Then there’s the satellite-based approach. This one uses the principle of\r\n  entanglement, which Einstein called “spooky action at a distance” and refused\r\n  to believe was real. Turns out, it is real and there is a quantum\r\n  communication satellite up and working for a couple of years now.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Entanglement isn’t about instantaneous communications that break the speed of\r\n  light speed limit. The way that it works is that two particles become\r\n  entangled so that they have the same state and then one of these particles is\r\n  sent to someone else. When the recipient looks at the particle, it’s\r\n  guaranteed to be the same state as its twin.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  If one of those particles changes, it doesn’t mean that the other particle\r\n  instantly changes to match - it’s not a communication system. Plus, the state\r\n  of the two entangled particles, while identical, is also random. So, you can’t\r\n  send a message, but you can send an encryption key, because what you really\r\n  want in a key is a sequence of random digits.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Now that the sender and the receiver both have the same random key, they can\r\n  then use it to send messages using symmetric encryption over traditional\r\n  channels. To receive the signals, companies would need to put something that\r\n  looks like a telescope on their rooftops and then install some processing\r\n  equipment.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Neither ground-based nor satellite-based quantum key distribution is practical\r\n  for general use since both require very specialised and expensive equipment.\r\n  It could, however, be useful for securing the most critical and sensitive\r\n  communications.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  If the integrity of the keys can be perfectly guaranteed by QKD, does that\r\n  mean that unhackable communications are within our reach?\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Most hackers, when they break into things, they hardly go head-on. They go\r\n  around the side, and that's where you'll find problems with these\r\n  implementations. Today’s attackers, while they could, in theory, listen in to\r\n  traffic over fibreoptic lines, typically don’t do that.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  There are far easier ways to read the messages, such as getting to the\r\n  messages before they are encrypted or after they are decrypted or using\r\n  man-in-the-middle attacks.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Additionally, QKD requires the use of relays. Unless the sender and the\r\n  recipient build a pipe that goes directly between their two offices, and the\r\n  distance is short enough that the messages don’t degrade — about 60 miles or\r\n  less with current technology — there will be plenty of opportunities for\r\n  hackers. QKD networks will need repeaters when messages travel long distances.\r\n  Those repeaters are going to become weak points and someone could hack in and\r\n  get the key.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Also, QKD networks will need to be able to route messages, and that means\r\n  routers and hubs, each of which is also a potential point of vulnerability.\r\n  Physicists can say, this is absolutely secure, but there’s a danger in that,\r\n  in thinking that just because you’re using QKD that you’re secure. Sure, the\r\n  laws of physics apply, but there might be ways around them.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Besides the security problems, it’s not realistic to expect that every\r\n  internet user will have access to an QKD endpoint anywhere in the near future.\r\n  That means, except for the most sensitive, high-value communications, better\r\n  encryption algorithms are the way to go.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n<h2>We are probably decades away from the point at which quantum computers can\r\n  be used to break today’s RSA encryption.

It gives developers new tools in the box of\r\n  tricks they use to carefully persuade today’s GPUs to draw immersive,\r\n  realistic, high-quality scenes at high performance.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Within the last couple of years, products have hit the high-end PC market that\r\n  support Microsoft’s DirectX Ray Tracing (DXR) specification. A number of\r\n  high-profile games that use DXR showcase the potential of the technology.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The great folks at Khronos have also recently released their view of ray\r\n  tracing as it applies to Vulkan. The resulting API will feel familiar to\r\n  students of DXR, giving developers another ray-tracing API to target and a\r\n  means to expand over time to platforms that aren't Windows.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  However, at the time of writing, all of the public implementations come from a\r\n  single vendor, Nvidia. Consequently, developers have a rather narrow view of\r\n  what makes an accelerated ray-tracing implementation based on DXR or Vulkan\r\n  ray tracing tick.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  That's no fault of Nvidia, the graphics giant taking advantage of their\r\n  ability to strong arm their view of ray tracing into DirectX and therefore\r\n  robustly influence the resulting capabilities in Vulkan. Any other vendor in\r\n  Nvidia's position would do the same, and the company's ability to productize\r\n  the output of its incredible research team is second to none.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  However, if that's how a new graphics capability comes into being, driven\r\n  almost completely by a single vendor in the beginning, resulting in a narrow\r\n  spectrum of implementations with limited market share, developers need to be\r\n  careful as that landscape of implementations broadens over time.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Multiple Design Paths</b> <br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  That's especially true when it comes to a largely black box feature like ray\r\n  tracing. What do we mean by black box? For any given hardware and software\r\n  specification in the semiconductor world, and that isn't limited to GPUs,\r\n  there's a huge design space you can explore to implement it.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  There's no one way to build a CPU for example, leading to a wide range of\r\n  practical instruction set architectures (ISAs) that can all run roughly the\r\n  same software. GPUs enjoy an even wider range of potential implementations\r\n  from different vendors because there's no standard ISA from which the industry\r\n  designs its implementations.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  GPU vendors take advantage of that to innovate more rapidly under the hood\r\n  compared to CPUs. That’s because the combination of hardware and software at\r\n  work can more readily hide what's under the hood doing the work at the silicon\r\n  level.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  So, when Nvidia proposed what became DXR to Microsoft, when specifying the\r\n  programming model and API that developers need to target to perform ray\r\n  tracing in their renderer, they left certain parts of it almost completely\r\n  undefined.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  That lack of guidance in parts of the specification is completely on purpose.\r\n  Why? It allows the underlying implementation of that bit of the specification\r\n  to be entirely specific to a given GPU and its driver. In fact, parts of DXR\r\n  and Vulkan ray tracing don't even need to run on the GPU at all!\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  And therein lies the rub: because of that, unlike almost every other feature\r\n  ever added to the real-time graphics pipeline in GPU history, ray tracing will\r\n  be very difficult for developers to target in a uniform way.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  That's further complicated by the fact that ray tracing is also bifurcating\r\n  from the developer's point of view, too, with a simpler model having emerged\r\n  from the full ray pipelines first specified. This allows for easier\r\n  implementation of some specific effects, particularly ray-traced shadows.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Advice for Developers</b> <br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  So, with two ray-tracing programming models for developers to target and still\r\n  only one generation of shipping accelerators to try it out on, and with key\r\n  parts of DXR and Vulkan ray tracing specified as completely\r\n  implementation-dependent, what should developers be aware of as things develop\r\n  in the ray-tracing acceleration space?\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  As a company developing ray-tracing acceleration for its future GPUs, where\r\n  our solution will have microarchitectural performance characteristics that are\r\n  necessarily different—and better by far, we hope—to those implementations from\r\n  other vendors, we have some simple advice.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  First, avoid any marketing claims about ray-tracing performance since there's\r\n  no standard way to describe it. The black box nature of the ray-tracing\r\n  specifications makes it almost impossible to do so anyway. Let's pick on one\r\n  of the most impressive GPUs ever made to push home the point: Nvidia's TU102\r\n  in GeForce RTX 2080 Ti form. It's a competing product so I shouldn't really\r\n  say this, but woof, it's one heck of a GPU.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Nvidia says there's a peak ray flow of 10 Grays/sec in that product, which is\r\n  an incredibly impressive headline number. Sadly, though, it doesn't actually\r\n  say anything concrete that you can understand as a consumer, developer, or\r\n  anyone else interested in the technology and how it works.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Does it only measure miss-only rate with empty rays, or is it measuring\r\n  real-world usable ray flow on rays with a proper payload? It's a marketing\r\n  number, so it's definitely a lot closer to the former than the latter,\r\n  unfortunately. It also doesn't tell you anything about the location of the\r\n  performance cliffs. Nor does it tell you how ray-tracing throughput degrades\r\n  with complexity of ray, hierarchy, or any of the other moving parts of the\r\n  ray-tracing system, and how it's all integrated with the rest of the rendering\r\n  workload.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  As a result, you're left with testing and measuring as your only realistic way\r\n  to determine what's possible with a given level of ray-tracing performance in\r\n  a GPU. That’s because Nvidia's 10 Grays/sec won't mean the same thing as the\r\n  same number quoted by Imagination, or any of the other vendors that will try\r\n  their hand at useful DXR or Vulkan ray-tracing acceleration for that matter.\r\n  It won't even mean the same thing generationally for Nvidia!\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Lastly, does that mean the graphics market now has a need for public software\r\n  that tests meaningful peak microarchitectural ray flow to expose\r\n  implementation-specific details, along with some measures of real-world\r\n  performance in idiomatic game-like settings? Absolutely, and we'd love to talk\r\n  to anyone who wants to tackle that problem, since it's a big missing piece of\r\n  the puzzle.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <h2>\r\n    Real-time graphics has entered a new era with the advent of ray tracing,\r\n    which delivers more realistic scenes than ever before.

WebAR</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/010620/arWeb.jpg\" alt=\"Web AR\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Instead of needing to use specialized apps, users can simply log on to\r\n  AR-enabled websites to access the same level of functionality. Google and\r\n  Mozilla are engaged with WebAR in order to bring AR solutions to Chrome and\r\n  Firefox respectively, though the prior is far ahead. Apple, Samsung and\r\n  Microsoft web browser offerings are also rapidly adopting the WebAR standards.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>4. Shopping</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/010620/arShopping.jpg\" alt=\"Shopping\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  At least 100 million users were expected to utilize AR-enabled shopping by\r\n  2020, according to a report from Gartner. The increase in the number of\r\n  AR-enabled mobile devices makes the job much easier for the industry. Everyone\r\n  can now comfortably use it as part of their daily experience. American\r\n  Apparel, Uniqlo and Lacoste have already deployed showrooms and fitting rooms\r\n  that provide try-before-you-buy options while IKEA has provided the customers\r\n  with the ability to browse and place furniture in their houses to see how it\r\n  would look. This might get adopted by many more retailers in the future not\r\n  just because it is convenient for the parties involved, but also because of\r\n  the new social distancing norms. Virtual assistants will also significantly\r\n  change the shopping experience.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>5. Navigation</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img\r\n  style=\"width: 100%\"\r\n  src=\"/img/blog/010620/arNavigation.jpg\"\r\n  alt=\"Navigation\"\r\n/>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  This is the obvious one. AR can not only be used for heads up displays in\r\n  automobiles, but also can make a significant contribution to indoor\r\n  navigation. Google maps already provides the consumers a good experience in\r\n  outdoor navigation. But now, AR can help them find their way indoors. ARCore\r\n  and ARKit based applications can already provide directions in airports,\r\n  malls, hospitals and office campuses. Last August, Google Maps launched a beta\r\n  version of its augmented reality walking directions feature that will\r\n  available to all AR-compatible Android and iOS mobile devices. With the help\r\n  of the inbuilt camera, users were able to see information regarding their\r\n  surroundings in real-time. The AR powered navigation is expected to conquer\r\n  new territories.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <h2\r\n    >According to experts, the AR/VR/MR/XR industry will be dominating in the\r\n    future and the growth will continue to be steady.</h2\r\n  >\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to the\r\n  author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation, committee\r\n  or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/Top Trends in Augmented Reality","extension":".md","createdAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.616Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.616Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1671873477253},"$loki":45},{"slug":"What are Best Practices","name":"What are Best Practices?","titleImage":"140920/title","briefdesc":"Brief explanation of commonly agreed upon best practices in software engineering.","postDate":"September 14, 2020","blogNumber":24,"toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"They are called \"best practices\" not because we can precisely quantify\n    their value but rather, they are observed to be commonly used in industry by\n    successful organizations."}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n  Best practices are a set of empirically proven approaches to software\n  development.

Absorbing material quickly, optimising\r\n  application, and streamlining interaction/workflow directly influences the\r\n  bottom line.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>VR is already making headway in a range of industries such as:</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside\">\r\n  <li>Healthcare.</li>\r\n  <li>Machine Operations.</li>\r\n  <li>Rehabilitation.</li>\r\n  <li>Corporate Training.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>4. Appealing to a Variety of Learning Styles</b><br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Classic teaching and training methods convey content to students according to\r\n  the instructor’s preferred style of learning. These styles are classified as\r\n  visual, auditory, tactical, and kinaesthetic. But what if multiple styles of\r\n  learning could be satisfied simultaneously? With VR learning, this is a new\r\n  reality. Although recent research raises questions about the utility of\r\n  addressing certain learning styles, the fact remains that people have strong\r\n  preferences for acquiring new skills and information. VR experiences access\r\n  all the senses, a variety of preferences can be satisfied and delighted. It\r\n  offers the ability to simultaneously reach students across at least three of\r\n  the four classical learning styles. Among education specialists in particular,\r\n  there is universal agreement on VR technology’s effectiveness and potential to\r\n  breathe new life into traditional teaching methods.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>5. Eliminating Risk and Safety Concerns</b><br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Medical students need to practice procedures without potentially harming a\r\n  patient through inexperience, or even curiosity. Firefighters and military\r\n  personnel need to learn how to respond in dangerous situations without risking\r\n  their lives.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  VR experiences can build extreme environments and situations, allowing users\r\n  to test and learn without severe consequences. This not only eliminates risk,\r\n  liability, and injury; it also allows users to more easily train and master\r\n  procedures, so, when the time comes, they’re prepared for the real deal. Added\r\n  bonus: With greater safety, comes fewer costs.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to the\r\n  author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation, committee\r\n  or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/Virtual Reality Advantages","extension":".md","createdAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.617Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-24T07:45:17.617Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1671873477261},"$loki":47},{"slug":"Virtual Test Drive & Autonomous Driving","name":"Virtual Test Drive & Autonomous Driving","titleImage":"050720/VTDtitle","briefdesc":"How autonomous driving technology can help us.","postDate":"July 05, 2020","blogNumber":14,"toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"As more and more companies are leaning into Virtual Test Driving, this list\n    could only increase and contribute more for a driver-less future."}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n  Autonomous vehicles are becoming more and more realistic by time.

But still most companies prefer cooking up their own game engines.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Third-party game engines will save you a lot of time in development while\r\n  in-house game engines will help you achieve better optimization. Obvious\r\n  choices as third -party game engines would have been Unreal Engine and Unity\r\n  3D for a long time.
