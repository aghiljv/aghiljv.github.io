From text, colours and\r\n  size of buttons, images, menus etc... front-end is all about what's visible to\r\n  the users. It is imperative that interfaces are pleasing to the eye of the\r\n  users as well as engaging for the success of an application, not to mention a\r\n  good design.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Front-end developers should understand the users to ensure prime functioning\r\n  of their application. But still, there are some mistakes often made. Here we\r\n  are focussing on 5 of them. These should be avoided to ensure a good user\r\n  base.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>1. Coding with Older HTML Standards</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/200420/html5.png\" alt=\"html5\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Many front-end developers stopped the practice of coding with old HTML\r\n  elements after HTML5 came into existence as the newest form of HTML. HTML5\r\n  allowed making a lot of changes in standard page design. As a matter of fact,\r\n  front-end development has a heavy reliance on browser support. And, some\r\n  browsers don’t get support from older HTML, which can become a burden in a\r\n  long run. With older HTML, the front-end of your site could also go devoid of\r\n  many modern and secure features that HTML5 is capable of bringing to your\r\n  site. Therefore, coding with older HTML could put your site at risk of\r\n  security attacks.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>2. Using Obsolete JavaScript Libraries</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  JavaScript libraries that will not be supported or maintained years later\r\n  could inflict adverse impacts on your site. If support is no longer available\r\n  for a JavaScript library that you used to build the front-end of your site,\r\n  you will find yourself in a difficult situation. You may eventually have a\r\n  dependency that is no longer functional.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  So, it’s good for you to choose JavaScript libraries with active support,\r\n  documentation, and consistent updates by their developers. It’s also important\r\n  to ensure that the popular libraries you choose will be maintained for years\r\n  to come. It's always wise to go for libraries that are supported by big brands\r\n  as they tend to last longer than most.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>3. Not Testing Code with Major Browsers</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/200420/browsers.png\" alt=\"browsers\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  If you miss out on testing your code for all the major browsers, your site\r\n  could lose users who still like to use the same older browsers. JavaScript and\r\n  client-side scripting are intrinsic part of front-end development. Therefore,\r\n  it’s important to test your code in all the major browsers. Front-end\r\n  developers can put into use their sites’ browsing analytics data to identify\r\n  common browsers they would like to support.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>4. Not Creating Responsive Mobile Design</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/200420/res.jpg\" alt=\"responsive\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  We have entered an era where people like to browse the web on phones rather\r\n  than desktops. The rising trend of internet surfing on mobile phones makes it\r\n  important to create a front-end design that is responsive and mobile-friendly.\r\n  Modern front-end coding entails responsive design as default.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  If users are unable to access your site on their smartphones, they become\r\n  likely to move to your competitors whose sites are easily accessible via their\r\n  smartphones. Google has also stated many times earlier that responsive design\r\n  is their preferred mobile configuration. It means responsive site and separate\r\n  mobile sites get ranking boost in search results way higher than those sites\r\n  that are unresponsive or not mobile-friendly.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Since mobile devices have varied screen sizes, it’s worth writing code that\r\n  supports all possible breakpoints. Developers can use emulators for testing to\r\n  avoid the hassle of dealing with several devices.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>5. No Focus on Site Speed</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Site speed directly affects bounce rates, conversion rates, revenue and user\r\n  satisfaction. Site speed depends on various factors. For example, client side\r\n  can become slow due to Spaghetti JavaScript code, whereas large images can\r\n  slow down page loading speed. Slow sites frustrate users, thus it’s beneficial\r\n  to put into use site speed testers that identify design elements responsible\r\n  for slowing down your site. Good site speed is also important from SEO\r\n  perspective as it is one of the factors search engines take into account for\r\n  rankings. Therefore, it’s a good practice to keep on testing your site and\r\n  keep a track over its performance.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <h2\r\n    >A front-end developer could easily avoid these common mistakes and ensure\r\n    that their site is easy to use and loads fast.

These chips connect sensors to actuators through\r\n  interfaces and high-performance ECUs (electronic controller units).\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Self-driving cars use a variety of these applications and technologies to gain\r\n  360-degree vision, both near (in the vehicle’s immediate vicinity) and far.\r\n  That means hardware designs are using more advanced process nodes to meet\r\n  ever-higher performance targets while simultaneously reducing demands on power\r\n  and footprint.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Some of the most common ADAS applications are:\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>1. Adaptive Cruise Control</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Adaptive cruise control (ACC) is particularly helpful on the highway, where\r\n  drivers can find it difficult to monitor their speed and other cars over a\r\n  long period of time. Advanced cruise control can automatically accelerate,\r\n  slow down, and at times stop the vehicle, depending on the actions other\r\n  objects in the immediate area.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>2. Glare-Free High Beam and Pixel Light</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Glare-free high beam and pixel light uses sensors to adjust to darkness and\r\n  the vehicle’s surroundings without disturbing oncoming traffic. This new\r\n  headlight application detects the lights of other vehicles and redirects the\r\n  vehicle’s lights away to prevent other road users from being temporarily\r\n  blinded.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>3. Adaptive Light Control</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Adaptive light control adapts the vehicle’s headlights to external lighting\r\n  conditions. It changes the strength, direction, and rotation of the headlights\r\n  depending on the vehicle’s environment and darkness.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>4. Automatic Parking </b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Automatic parking helps inform drivers of blind spots so they know when to\r\n  turn the steering wheel and stop. Vehicles equipped with rearview cameras have\r\n  a better view of their surroundings than traditional side mirrors. Some\r\n  systems can even complete parking automatically without the driver’s help by\r\n  combining the input of multiple sensors.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b> 5. Autonomous Valet Parking</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Autonomous valet parking is a new technology that works via vehicle sensor\r\n  meshing, 5G network communication, with cloud services that manage autonomous\r\n  vehicles in parking areas. The vehicles sensors provide the vehicle with\r\n  information about where it is, where it needs to go, and how to get there\r\n  safely. All this information is methodically evaluated and used to perform\r\n  drive acceleration, braking, and steering until the vehicle is safely parked.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>6. Navigation System</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Car navigation systems provide on-screen instructions and voice prompts to\r\n  help drivers follow a route while concentrating on the road. Some navigation\r\n  systems can display exact traffic data and, if necessary, plan a new route to\r\n  avoid traffic jams. Advanced systems may even offer Heads Up Displays (HuD) to\r\n  reduce driver distraction.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>7. Night Vision</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Night vision systems enable drivers to see things that would otherwise be\r\n  difficult or impossible to see at night. There are two categories of night\r\n  vision implementations: Active night vision systems project infrared light,\r\n  and passive systems rely on the thermal energy that comes from cars, animals,\r\n  and other objects.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>8. Blind Spot Monitoring</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Blind spot detection systems use sensors to provide drivers with important\r\n  information that is otherwise difficult or impossible to obtain. Some systems\r\n  sound an alarm when they detect an object in the driver’s blind spot, such as\r\n  when the driver tries to move into an occupied lane.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>9. Automatic Emergency Braking</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Automatic emergency braking uses sensors to detect whether the driver is in\r\n  the process of hitting another vehicle or other objects on the road. This\r\n  application can measure the distance of nearby traffic and alert the driver to\r\n  any danger. Some emergency braking systems can take preventive safety\r\n  measures, such as tightening seat belts, reducing speed, and adaptive steering\r\n  to avoid a collision.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>10. Crosswind Stabilization</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  This relatively new ADAS feature supports the vehicle in counteracting strong\r\n  crosswinds. The sensors in this system can detect strong pressure acting on\r\n  the vehicle while driving and apply brakes to the wheels affected by crosswind\r\n  disturbance.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>11. Driver Drowsiness Detection</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Driver drowsiness detection warns drivers of sleepiness or other road\r\n  distractions. There are several ways to determine whether a driver’s attention\r\n  is decreasing. In one case, sensors can analyze the movement of the driver’s\r\n  head, and heart rate to determine whether they indicate drowsiness. Other\r\n  systems issue driver alerts similar to the warning signals for lane detection.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>12. Driver Monitoring System</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The driver monitoring system is another way of measuring the driver’s\r\n  attention. The camera sensors can analyze whether the driver’s eyes are on the\r\n  road or drifting. Driver monitoring systems can alert drivers with noises,\r\n  vibrations in the steering wheel, or flashing lights. In some cases, the car\r\n  will take the extreme measure of stopping the vehicle completely.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n<h2>Automobiles are the foundation of the next generation of mobile-connected\r\n  devices, with rapid advances being made in autonomous vehicles.</h2>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to\r\n  the author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation,\r\n  committee or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/ADAS","extension":".md","slug":"ADAS","createdAt":"2020-12-31T09:14:36.885Z","updatedAt":"2020-12-31T09:24:33.771Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1614332446817},"$loki":6},{"name":"Blockchains - How and Why?","titleImage":"221120/title","briefdesc":"The basic structure and functioning of the blockchains.","postDate":"November 22, 2020","toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n  Blockchains are incredibly popular nowadays.

Since that time, we have\r\n  developed increasingly fluid methods for human-computer interaction with\r\n  keyboards, mouses, monitors and touchscreens which now dominate our digital\r\n  lives. But what if we could link the computational wetware in our own heads\r\n  directly with a computer.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Brain computer interfaces or BCI's could include either input or output\r\n  devices. Input BCI's are comprised of sensors which acquire electrical brain\r\n  wave signals together with processing hardware that extracts distinct features\r\n  and translates them into useful commands. The other way around output BCI's\r\n  translate digital information into electrical signals that are fed into the\r\n  user’s brain by electrode arrays or other stimulator hardware.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  BCI's may be constructed using one of two approaches.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The first is non-invasive and may employ electroencephalography or EEG to\r\n  acquire brainwave signals from sensors positioned on the outside of the skull.\r\n  Alternatively, non invasive BCI's may feed electrical signals into the brain\r\n  using a TMS or Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation device.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The second way to build a BCI is invasive and currently requires surgery to\r\n  position sensors or stimulators inside the skull. Two output technologies have\r\n  so far been trialled, with the first known as electrocorticography or ECoG,\r\n  placing a strip or grid of electrodes on the surface of the brain.\r\n  Alternatively, intracortical microelectrodes can be implanted a few\r\n  millimetres into the brain where they may serve as either sensors or\r\n  stimulators.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  For obvious reasons today most BCI research is non-invasive. This limits its\r\n  scope and application but even so some interesting results have been achieved.\r\n  Perhaps most notably, many researchers have used EEG to acquire P300 brain\r\n  waves which are then processed to allow a user to input letters or commands\r\n  into a computer. Such interfaces are painstakingly slow, but without doubt\r\n  they can work.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Researchers at the University of Washington have even used non-invasive BCI's\r\n  to send commands from one person's brain to another over the Internet.\r\n  Specifically, in a set of experiments in 2014 one test subject wore an EEG\r\n  skullcap while watching a monitor screen on which a computer game was being\r\n  displayed. But the fire button was in the hand of a second subject seated half\r\n  a mile away in another building and who had a TMS coil placed over the brain.\r\n  To shoot down Rockets the first user had to think about pressing the fire\r\n  button. When that happened, brainwave signals were acquired by EEG, processed\r\n  and transmitted over the Internet. In turn the TMS device induced an\r\n  electrical pulse into the receiving subject’s brain so causing them to\r\n  experience visual stimuli and press the fire button. Amazingly the\r\n  split-second accuracy required to shoot down Rockets was achieved. In fact,\r\n  across three pairs of test subjects, success rate between 25% and 83% was\r\n  obtained.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  In time, University of Washington researchers hope to use BCI's to transmit\r\n  more complex ideas and thoughts from one brain to another. This could even\r\n  allow for what they call brain tutoring in which knowledge is transferred\r\n  directly from the brain of a teacher to the brain of a student. The team at\r\n  the University of Washington use highly sophisticated sensors stimulators and\r\n  processing hardware.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  However basic EEG BCI's are now available for consumers including the Emotiv\r\n  EPOC, the InteraXon Muse and the Neurosky MindWave. Such low-end hardware\r\n  might actually record electromyographic signals from muscles in addition to or\r\n  even in place of electroencephalographic signals from the brain.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  For many years, we've been learning how to interface electronic hardware with\r\n  the human body.

You\r\n  have to keep in mind the power requirement of every other component in your\r\n  build and then while choosing the PSU, it should cover all those needs. Always\r\n  go for PSUs with an 80+ certification. There are 80+ white, bronze, silver,\r\n  gold, platinum and titanium certifications. It just refers to the efficiency\r\n  of the PSU in delivering the power. 80+ means, it will do it with at least 80%\r\n  efficiency. If you did not choose the PSU well, it might even cost you the\r\n  whole build.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Case</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/290620/case.jpg\" alt=\"Case\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Nowadays there are a wide variety of choices for the cases. But you have to\r\n  consider the size of your components before deciding on a model, especially\r\n  your Motherboard. The cases come from mini-ATX to ATX sizes. The ATX cases\r\n  will usually support smaller motherboards but not vice-versa. Also, you have\r\n  to make sure you have enough space to install extra fans in order t provide\r\n  better cooling to your build.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Fans and Coolers</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img\r\n  style=\"width: 100%\"\r\n  src=\"/img/blog/290620/fans.jpg\"\r\n  alt=\"Fans and Coolers\"\r\n/>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  When you are building a high-performance PC, the components are going to\r\n  generate a good amount of heat. Most of the components cannot work beyond a\r\n  level of temperature. The CPU should have a dedicated cooler – no questions\r\n  asked. You can have air/water cooling according to your need and convenience.\r\n  Most of the new AMD processors, comes with a stock cooler, but you could opt\r\n  for another cooler as per your need. In case of Intel, you have to buy a\r\n  separate cooler. Also, the Case accumulate more and more heat, if there was\r\n  not enough circulation. So, you have to make sure of the same in order to keep\r\n  your components in an optimum temperature, which will not only result in\r\n  higher performance, but also the longevity of them.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Monitor/s</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/290620/monitor.jpg\" alt=\"Monitor\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  This should be a no-brainer. You must have a monitor. But now there are lot of\r\n  choices out there. If you are a creator, it is better to go with a monitor\r\n  that offer high resolution and more colors. But if you are building a gaming\r\n  PC, a 1080p or 1440p resolution screen with high refresh rate and response\r\n  time is the one you should go with. There are screens that offer higher\r\n  resolution and high refresh rate together. But they are much more costly and\r\n  you also need costlier components to push that much data into the monitor.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Keyboard & Mouse</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img\r\n  style=\"width: 100%\"\r\n  src=\"/img/blog/290620/keymouse.jpg\"\r\n  alt=\"Keyboard & Mouse\"\r\n/>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  There are lot of options for keyboard and mouse now. These components are\r\n  unavoidable for the inputs. With the choices available, I think one should\r\n  explore on this one and choose for themselves. If it were me, I would go with\r\n  a branded model which serves all the necessary needs, nothing fancy.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <h2\r\n    >Knowing and choosing the individual components for your PC will make you\r\n    understand more about how it all works and will help you get the most out\r\n    your PC.</h2\r\n  >\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to the\r\n  author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation, committee\r\n  or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/How to choose components for a desktop PC on your own","extension":".md","slug":"How to choose components for a desktop PC on your own","createdAt":"2020-09-10T14:34:36.403Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-20T08:32:20.839Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1614332446853},"$loki":13},{"name":"How do browsers work","titleImage":"121020/title","briefdesc":"How does a typical browser loads and displays a webpage.","postDate":"October 11, 2020","toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n  Without the modern browsers, the internet will be pretty much a boring place.\n  You just enter an address and the browser will take care of everything.

Perhaps, thanks to advancements in extended reality (XR), an umbrella\r\n  term used to describe immersive technologies that can merge the physical and\r\n  virtual worlds, you might be able to shop for a new home anywhere in the world\r\n  as if you were actually on-site or head to lunch in some faraway land. By\r\n  2022, the XR market is expected to reach $209 billion, which is eight times\r\n  what it is today. This tremendous growth could mean the realities of our 2030\r\n  lives are beyond our imagination’s ability to grasp.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>What is extended reality (XR)?</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  XR is an emerging umbrella term for all the immersive technologies. The ones\r\n  we already have today—augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed\r\n  reality (MR) plus those that are still to be created. All immersive\r\n  technologies extend the reality we experience by either blending the virtual\r\n  and “real” worlds or by creating a fully immersive experience. Recent research\r\n  revealed that more than 60% of respondents believed XR will be mainstream in\r\n  the next five years. To get a better picture of XR, let’s review each of the\r\n  existing technologies that exist today.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Virtual reality (VR)</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/100820/vrXr.jpg\" alt=\"VR\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  In virtual reality, users are fully immersed in a simulated digital\r\n  environment. Individuals must put on a VR headset or head-mounted display to\r\n  get a 360 -degree view of an artificial world that fools their brain into\r\n  believing they are, e.g., walking on the moon, swimming under the ocean or\r\n  stepped into whatever new world the VR developers created. The gaming and\r\n  entertainment industry were early adopters of this technology; however,\r\n  companies in several industries such as healthcare, construction, engineering,\r\n  the military, and more are finding VR to be very useful.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Augmented reality (AR)</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/100820/arXr.jpg\" alt=\"XR\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  In augmented reality, virtual information and objects are overlaid on the real\r\n  world. This experience enhances the real world with digital details such as\r\n  images, text, and animation. You can access the experience through AR glasses\r\n  or via screens, tablets, and smartphones. This means users are not isolated\r\n  from the real world and can still interact and see what’s going on in front of\r\n  them. The most well-known examples of AR are the Pokémon GO game that overlays\r\n  digital creatures onto the real world or Snapchat filters that put digital\r\n  objects such as hats or glasses onto your head.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Mixed reality (MR)</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/100820/mrXr.jpg\" alt=\"MR\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  In mixed reality, digital and real-world objects co-exist and can interact\r\n  with one another in real-time.

With the digitization of manufacturing, we are in the\r\n  midst of a significant transformation regarding the way we produce products.\r\n  This transition is so compelling that it is being called Industry 4.0 to\r\n  represent the fourth revolution that has occurred in manufacturing.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The first industrial revolution came with the advent of mechanisation, steam\r\n  power and water power. This was followed by the second industrial revolution,\r\n  which revolved around mass production and assembly lines using electricity.\r\n  The third industrial revolution came with electronics, I.T. systems and\r\n  automation, which led to the fourth industrial revolution that is associated\r\n  with cyber physical systems.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  When computers were introduced in Industry 3.0, it was disruptive. Now, and\r\n  into the future as Industry 4.0 unfolds, computers are connected and\r\n  communicate with one another to ultimately make decisions without human\r\n  involvement. A combination of cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things\r\n  and the Internet of Systems make Industry 4.0 possible and the smart factory a\r\n  reality. As a result of the support of smart machines that keep getting\r\n  smarter as they get access to more data, our factories will become more\r\n  efficient and productive and less wasteful. Ultimately, it's the network of\r\n  these machines that are digitally connected with one another and create and\r\n  share information that results in the true power of Industry 4.0.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Many organizations are implementing changes today and preparing for a future\r\n  where smart machines improve their business. Here are just a few of the\r\n  possible applications:\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>Autonomous equipment and vehicles</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  There are shipping yards that are leveraging autonomous cranes and trucks to\r\n  streamline operations as they accept shipping containers from the ships.\r\n  Autonomous vehicles can provide more efficient logistics and passenger\r\n  transfer methods. Furthermore, smart sensors along with implementation of\r\n  cognitive computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) represent an AV as a\r\n  cyber-physical system (CPS), within which information from all related\r\n  perspectives is closely monitored and synchronized between the physical\r\n  devices and the cyber computational space. By utilizing advanced information\r\n  analytics, AVs will be able to perform more efficiently, collaboratively and\r\n  resiliently. Thus, it is possible to integrate AVs into Industry 4.0 systems.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>Internet of Things (IoT) and the cloud</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  A key component of Industry 4.0 is the Internet of Things that is\r\n  characterized by connected devices. Not only does this help internal\r\n  operations, but through the use of the cloud environment where data is stored,\r\n  equipment and operations can be optimized by leveraging the insights of others\r\n  using the same equipment or to allow smaller enterprises access to technology\r\n  they wouldn’t be able to on their own.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>Digital Twins</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Since connected machines collect a tremendous volume of data that can inform\r\n  maintenance, performance and other issues, as well as analyse that data to\r\n  identify patterns and insights that would be impossible for a human to do in a\r\n  reasonable timeframe, Industry 4.0 offers the opportunity for manufacturers to\r\n  optimize their operations quickly and efficiently by knowing what needs\r\n  attention.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>Optimize logistics and supply chains</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  A connected supply chain can adjust and accommodate when new information is\r\n  presented. If a weather delay ties up a shipment, a connected system can\r\n  proactively adjust to that reality and modify manufacturing priorities.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>Robots</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Once only possible for large enterprises with equally large budgets, robotics\r\n  is now more affordable and available to organizations of every size. From\r\n  picking products at a warehouse to getting them ready to ship, autonomous\r\n  robots can quickly and safely support manufacturers. Robots move goods around\r\n  Amazon warehouses and also reduce costs and allow better use of floor space\r\n  for the online retailer.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <b>3D Printing</b>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  This technology has improved tremendously in the last decade and has\r\n  progressed from primarily being used for prototyping to actual production.\r\n  Advances in the use of metal additive manufacturing have opened up a lot of\r\n  possibilities for production.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to the\r\n  author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation, committee\r\n  or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/Industry 4","extension":".md","slug":"Industry 4","createdAt":"2020-11-15T05:59:19.054Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-20T08:32:20.831Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1614332446872},"$loki":18},{"name":"Internet of Things","titleImage":"281220/title","briefdesc":"A brief introduction to Internet of Things or IoT.","postDate":"December 27, 2020","toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"It would not be crazy to see that we may live in a future, like how it is\n  depicted in sci-fi movies.

And\r\n  that’s not all – when engineers place a call to a support line, the remote\r\n  expert has a ‘you see what I see’ view, allowing them to provide guidance as\r\n  if they were physically present on the customer site.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <h2\r\n    >By adopting the right technology such as Mixed Reality, at the right time,\r\n    businesses will thrive as the Industry 4.0 gathers pace.</h2\r\n  >\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to the\r\n  author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation, committee\r\n  or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/Industry 4 & Mixed Reality","extension":".md","slug":"Industry 4 & Mixed Reality","createdAt":"2020-09-10T14:31:01.204Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-20T08:32:20.839Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1614332446889},"$loki":23},{"name":"Physics Engine","titleImage":"150221/title","briefdesc":"How do physics engines help create a better experience for games and simulations.","postDate":"February 12, 2021","toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"Game physics engines enhance the player's enjoyment by simulating the\n  complex physical characteristics of a virtual world while scientific physics\n  engines use an approximation of real-world physics to quickly simulate complex\n  world interactions.\n"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n  A physics engine describes a software program that is used to simulate\n  physical phenomena.

In computer science, cryptography refers to secure\r\n  information and communication techniques derived from mathematical concepts\r\n  and a set of rule-based calculations called algorithms, to transform messages\r\n  in ways that are hard to decipher. These deterministic algorithms are used for\r\n  cryptographic key generation, digital signing, verification to protect data\r\n  privacy, web browsing on the internet and confidential communications such as\r\n  credit card transactions and email.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Cryptography is closely related to the disciplines of cryptology and\r\n  cryptanalysis. It includes techniques such as microdots, merging words with\r\n  images and other ways to hide information in storage or transit. However, in\r\n  today's computer-centric world, cryptography is most often associated with\r\n  scrambling plaintext (ordinary text, sometimes referred to as cleartext) into\r\n  ciphertext (a process called encryption), then back again (known as\r\n  decryption).

Non-repudiation</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The creator/sender of the information cannot deny at a later stage his or her\r\n  intentions in the creation or transmission of the information.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>4.

One thing for sure is we must never put this inside a production code.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to the\r\n  author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation, committee\r\n  or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/Processes for Better Software Volume 3","extension":".md","slug":"Processes for Better Software Volume 3","createdAt":"2020-11-01T04:39:01.055Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-20T08:32:20.839Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1614332446906},"$loki":29},{"name":"Quantum Computers","titleImage":"071220/title","briefdesc":"What is a quantum computer and how is different from a traditional computer?","postDate":"December 6, 2020","toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"We still have no idea where the limits of quantum computers are and but it\n  will revolutionize the industry for sure."}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n  Since the 1960's, the power of our machines has kept growing exponentially,\n  allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time.

Sometimes, some engineers\r\n  consider something as the way to do it. But that opinion might not be shared\r\n  by many others.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Now, there are a lot of things I mean from them like paradigms, how we\r\n  separate concerns or even whether using nested ternaries is good or bad. Not\r\n  just the use of semicolons, tabs vs. spaces or formatting. Most of these\r\n  preferences and ideals are influenced by our environments, technologies we use\r\n  and coworkers.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Coworkers</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/051020/coworkers.jpg\" alt=\"Coworkers\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  In our careers, almost all of us will encounter people from many spectrums.\r\n  There will be people who are extremely motivated and passionate about what\r\n  they are building. Also, there are people who are just the opposite. Yes, it\r\n  is not just black and white, there is a lot of grey in between.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  No engineer can’t do it all by themselves. There might be someone who reads\r\n  this and having a smirk saying, I am a team of one or I code this many hours a\r\n  day, I turned my startup to unicorn all by myself. But you still might have\r\n  used open source frameworks or might have stumbled upon a problem and had\r\n  help. Point is, you have had help from other human beings. (Oh, if you have\r\n  done it without any of these. Respect!)\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The people we work with, greatly influences the way we code. Certain\r\n  engineers, as all humans do, will have predilections. For example, whoever\r\n  started building the product might have loved a certain framework and would\r\n  have refused to let it go even though its time has come and gone long ago. Or\r\n  they didn’t like seeing style.css files in your project and done all the\r\n  styling with inline CSS. Now, you might have to follow through as this may be\r\n  the available option.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  But it goes beyond that. Even the choices of people working on the product\r\n  from another team will also mold your code. If you are a front-end engineer,\r\n  you will probably need some data. Those data will be usually from the back-end\r\n  engineers. They are going to tell you, how and when you are going to get it\r\n  and in which format. So, this will influence how you write your interactions\r\n  with the API and your data layer, if you might.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Also, if you are working with people who are significantly smarter, with more\r\n  experience and cares about us and our code getting better, you will find\r\n  yourself writing better code through time.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Environmental influences</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<img style=\"width: 100%\" src=\"/img/blog/051020/environment.jpg\" alt=\"Environmental influences\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Your priorities are going mainly to be a function of the size of your company\r\n  or your team.

If there isn’t any, you might\r\n  not get things done as quickly as you could have. Instead, you might write\r\n  more tests or write less future legacy codes.

You can’t guarantee that your post-quantum algorithm will be secure\r\n  against a future quantum computer that uses some unknown quantum algorithm.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Quantum key distribution is unhackable, in theory!</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  This is where the laws of quantum physics can come to the rescue. Quantum key\r\n  distribution (QKD) is a method of sending encryption keys using some very\r\n  peculiar behaviours of subatomic particles that is, in theory at least,\r\n  completely unhackable. The land-based version of QKD is a system where photons\r\n  are sent one at a time through a fibreoptic line. If anyone is eavesdropping,\r\n  then, according to the principles of quantum physics, the polarization of the\r\n  photons is affected, and the recipient can tell that the message isn’t secure.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  However, the technology is extremely slow and requires expensive equipment to\r\n  send and receive the individual photons. A customer would need to buy a\r\n  transmitter and a receiver - both very costly as of now. It’s not too terribly\r\n  different from other high-speed fibre optics communication equipment and the\r\n  price will come down over time as more companies provide the hardware.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The big breakthrough last year was that QKD systems no longer require special\r\n  pipes. Now it looks like they’ll be able to use existing fibre networks, so\r\n  they don’t have to lay new fibre.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Then there’s the satellite-based approach. This one uses the principle of\r\n  entanglement, which Einstein called “spooky action at a distance” and refused\r\n  to believe was real. Turns out, it is real and there is a quantum\r\n  communication satellite up and working for a couple of years now.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Entanglement isn’t about instantaneous communications that break the speed of\r\n  light speed limit. The way that it works is that two particles become\r\n  entangled so that they have the same state and then one of these particles is\r\n  sent to someone else. When the recipient looks at the particle, it’s\r\n  guaranteed to be the same state as its twin.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  If one of those particles changes, it doesn’t mean that the other particle\r\n  instantly changes to match - it’s not a communication system. Plus, the state\r\n  of the two entangled particles, while identical, is also random. So, you can’t\r\n  send a message, but you can send an encryption key, because what you really\r\n  want in a key is a sequence of random digits.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Now that the sender and the receiver both have the same random key, they can\r\n  then use it to send messages using symmetric encryption over traditional\r\n  channels. To receive the signals, companies would need to put something that\r\n  looks like a telescope on their rooftops and then install some processing\r\n  equipment.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Neither ground-based nor satellite-based quantum key distribution is practical\r\n  for general use since both require very specialised and expensive equipment.\r\n  It could, however, be useful for securing the most critical and sensitive\r\n  communications.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>The limits of quantum key distribution</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  If the integrity of the keys can be perfectly guaranteed by QKD, does that\r\n  mean that unhackable communications are within our reach?\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Most hackers, when they break into things, they hardly go head-on. They go\r\n  around the side, and that's where you'll find problems with these\r\n  implementations. Today’s attackers, while they could, in theory, listen in to\r\n  traffic over fibreoptic lines, typically don’t do that.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  There are far easier ways to read the messages, such as getting to the\r\n  messages before they are encrypted or after they are decrypted or using\r\n  man-in-the-middle attacks.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Additionally, QKD requires the use of relays. Unless the sender and the\r\n  recipient build a pipe that goes directly between their two offices, and the\r\n  distance is short enough that the messages don’t degrade — about 60 miles or\r\n  less with current technology — there will be plenty of opportunities for\r\n  hackers. QKD networks will need repeaters when messages travel long distances.\r\n  Those repeaters are going to become weak points and someone could hack in and\r\n  get the key.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Also, QKD networks will need to be able to route messages, and that means\r\n  routers and hubs, each of which is also a potential point of vulnerability.\r\n  Physicists can say, this is absolutely secure, but there’s a danger in that,\r\n  in thinking that just because you’re using QKD that you’re secure. Sure, the\r\n  laws of physics apply, but there might be ways around them.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Besides the security problems, it’s not realistic to expect that every\r\n  internet user will have access to an QKD endpoint anywhere in the near future.\r\n  That means, except for the most sensitive, high-value communications, better\r\n  encryption algorithms are the way to go.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n<h2>We are probably decades away from the point at which quantum computers can\r\n  be used to break today’s RSA encryption.

Shaders are used when\r\n  detailing shadows, lighting, texture gradients and more. However, they can do\r\n  a lot more than just their namesake. You can often see shaders being packaged\r\n  as mods for games, transforming the dull, pixelated games into stunning,\r\n  sun-soaked landscapes.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Shader is a set of instructions that runs on the GPU (Graphics Processing\r\n  Unit). GPU is a processing unit or a circuit, specially designed for faster\r\n  and efficient computer graphics operation or image manipulation.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Shaders are categorised based on their functionality.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Vertex Shader</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Vertex shader transforms each vertex's 3D position in virtual space to the 2D\r\n  coordinate at which it appears on the screen (as well as a depth value for the\r\n  Z-buffer). Vertex shaders can manipulate properties such as position, colour\r\n  and texture coordinates, but cannot create new vertices. The output of the\r\n  vertex shader goes to the next stage in the pipeline, which is either a\r\n  geometry shader if present, or the rasterizer. Vertex shaders can enable\r\n  powerful control over the details of position, movement, lighting, and colour\r\n  in any scene involving 3D models.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Pixel Shader</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Pixel shaders, also known as fragment shaders, compute colour and other\r\n  attributes of each \"fragment\"- a unit of rendering work affecting at most a\r\n  single output pixel. The simplest kinds of pixel shaders output one screen\r\n  pixel as a colour value. More complex shaders with multiple inputs/outputs are\r\n  also possible. Pixel shaders range from simply always outputting the same\r\n  colour, to applying a lighting value, to doing bump mapping, shadows, specular\r\n  highlights, translucency and other phenomena.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Tessellation Shader</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  As of OpenGL 4.0 and Direct3D 11, a new shader class called a tessellation\r\n  shader has been added. It adds two new shader stages to the traditional model-\r\n  tessellation control shaders (also known as hull shaders) and tessellation\r\n  evaluation shaders (also known as Domain Shaders), which together allow for\r\n  simpler meshes to be subdivided into finer meshes at run-time according to a\r\n  mathematical function. The function can be related to a variety of variables,\r\n  most notably the distance from the viewing camera to allow active\r\n  level-of-detail scaling. This allows objects close to the camera to have fine\r\n  detail, while further away ones can have coarser meshes, yet seem comparable\r\n  in quality. It also can drastically reduce required mesh bandwidth by allowing\r\n  meshes to be refined once inside the shader units instead of down-sampling\r\n  very complex ones from memory.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Geometry Shader</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The geometry shader is responsible for the creation of new rendering\r\n  primitives parting from the output of the vertex shader. A geometry shader is\r\n  executed once per primitive, which is, in the worst case (when it is used to\r\n  emit point primitives), the same as the vertex shader. The best-case scenario\r\n  is when it is used to emit triangles, because only then will it be executed\r\n  three times less than the vertex shader, but this complexity is relative.\r\n  Although the geometry shader's execution could be cheap, it always increases\r\n  the scene's complexity, and that always translates into more computational\r\n  time spent by the GPU to render the scene.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Compute Shader</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The compute shader is a general-purpose shader that is used outside of a\r\n  rendering pipeline.

It's a competing product so I shouldn't really\r\n  say this, but woof, it's one heck of a GPU.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Nvidia says there's a peak ray flow of 10 Grays/sec in that product, which is\r\n  an incredibly impressive headline number. Sadly, though, it doesn't actually\r\n  say anything concrete that you can understand as a consumer, developer, or\r\n  anyone else interested in the technology and how it works.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Does it only measure miss-only rate with empty rays, or is it measuring\r\n  real-world usable ray flow on rays with a proper payload? It's a marketing\r\n  number, so it's definitely a lot closer to the former than the latter,\r\n  unfortunately. It also doesn't tell you anything about the location of the\r\n  performance cliffs. Nor does it tell you how ray-tracing throughput degrades\r\n  with complexity of ray, hierarchy, or any of the other moving parts of the\r\n  ray-tracing system, and how it's all integrated with the rest of the rendering\r\n  workload.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  As a result, you're left with testing and measuring as your only realistic way\r\n  to determine what's possible with a given level of ray-tracing performance in\r\n  a GPU. That’s because Nvidia's 10 Grays/sec won't mean the same thing as the\r\n  same number quoted by Imagination, or any of the other vendors that will try\r\n  their hand at useful DXR or Vulkan ray-tracing acceleration for that matter.\r\n  It won't even mean the same thing generationally for Nvidia!\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Lastly, does that mean the graphics market now has a need for public software\r\n  that tests meaningful peak microarchitectural ray flow to expose\r\n  implementation-specific details, along with some measures of real-world\r\n  performance in idiomatic game-like settings? Absolutely, and we'd love to talk\r\n  to anyone who wants to tackle that problem, since it's a big missing piece of\r\n  the puzzle.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  <h2>\r\n    Real-time graphics has entered a new era with the advent of ray tracing,\r\n    which delivers more realistic scenes than ever before. But all current\r\n    implementations centre around one vendor—and that raises issues, especially\r\n    when the competitive field expands.\r\n  </h2>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to the\r\n  author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation, committee\r\n  or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/The Perils of Ray-Tracing","extension":".md","slug":"The Perils of Ray-Tracing","createdAt":"2020-09-10T14:42:18.571Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-20T08:32:20.839Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1614332446939},"$loki":37},{"name":"Top features of Unreal Engine","titleImage":"180520/unrealTitle","briefdesc":"Article about benefits of using Unreal Engine.","postDate":"May 18, 2020","toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"Along with enhancing the existing features, Unreal Engine 5 does bring a\n    lot new to the table.

In the past couple\r\n  of decades, we have gone from relying on corded phones for the bulk of our\r\n  communication to tiny computers in our pockets that are capable of dozens of\r\n  simultaneous communication functions.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  If smartphones were one of the major tech developments of the 2000s,\r\n  development of smart homes are without a doubt, a big new step.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Smart home technology generally refers to any suite of devices, appliances, or\r\n  systems that connect into a common network that can be independently and\r\n  remotely controlled. When your home technology works together in one system,\r\n  it can also be referred more loosely as a “connected home”. For example, your\r\n  home's lights, audio speakers, TVs, security cameras, locks, appliances and\r\n  more are all connected into a common system, which can be controlled from your\r\n  smart phone or through a mobile touch screen device.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Smart home automation allows you to tap into high-tech functionality and\r\n  luxury that wasn’t possible in the past. As technology development continues\r\n  to expand, so will the possibilities for consumer home automation to make life\r\n  easier and more enjoyable.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  You might think of smart home automation as a nifty way to keep up with the\r\n  latest technology, or an opportunity for homeowners to show off, but there are\r\n  some amazing practical advantages to home automation. They are:\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Flexibility for new devices and appliances</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Smart home systems tend to be wonderfully flexible when it comes to the\r\n  accommodation of new devices and appliances and other technology. No matter\r\n  how state-of-the-art your appliances seem today, there will be newer, more\r\n  impressive models developed as time goes on. Beyond that, you’ll probably add\r\n  to your suite of devices as you replace the older ones or discover new\r\n  technology to accompany your indoor and outdoor spaces. Being able to\r\n  integrate these newcomers seamlessly will make your job as a homeowner much\r\n  easier and allow you to keep upgrading to the latest lifestyle technology.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Maximizing home security</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  When you incorporate security and surveillance features in your smart home\r\n  network, your home security can skyrocket. Only a few dozen are being explored\r\n  currently over a plethora of options. For example, home automation systems can\r\n  connect motion detectors, surveillance cameras, automated door locks and other\r\n  tangible security measures throughout your home so you can activate them from\r\n  one mobile device before heading to bed. You can also choose to receive\r\n  security alerts on your various devices depending on the time of day an alert\r\n  goes off and monitor activities in real-time whether you’re in the house or\r\n  halfway around the globe.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Managing all of your home devices from one place</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  The convenience factor here is enormous. Being able to keep all of the\r\n  technology in your home connected through one interface is a massive step\r\n  forward for technology and home management. Theoretically, all you’ll have to\r\n  do is learn how to use one app on your smartphone or tablet or both and you’ll\r\n  be able to tap into countless functions and devices throughout your home. This\r\n  cuts way back on the learning curve for new users, makes it easier to access\r\n  the functionality you truly want for your home.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Increased energy efficiency</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Depending on how you use your smart-home technology, it is possible to make\r\n  your space more energy-efficient. For example, you can have more precise\r\n  control over the heating and cooling of your home with a programmable smart\r\n  thermostat that learns your schedule and temperature preferences, and then\r\n  suggests the best energy efficient settings throughout the day. Lights and\r\n  motorized shades can be programmed to switch to an evening mode as the sun\r\n  sets or lights can turn on and off automatically when you enter or leave the\r\n  room, so you never have to worry about wasting energy.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Improved appliance functionality</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Smart homes can also help you run your appliances better. A smart TV will help\r\n  you find better apps and channels to locate your favourite programming. A\r\n  smart oven will assist you with cooking your chicken to perfection, without\r\n  ever worrying about overcooking or undercooking it. An intelligently designed\r\n  home theatre and audio system can make managing your movie and music\r\n  collection effortless when entertaining guests. Ultimately, connecting your\r\n  appliances and other systems with automation technology will improve your\r\n  appliance effectiveness and overall make your home life much more easier and\r\n  enjoyable!\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Remote control of home functions</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Don’t underestimate the power of being able to control your home’s functions\r\n  from a distance. On an exceptionally hot day, you can order your house to\r\n  become cooler in just enough time before you get home from work. If you are in\r\n  a hurry to get dinner started but is still at the store, you can have your\r\n  oven start to preheat while you are still on your way home. You can even check\r\n  to see if you left the lights on, who is at your front door or make sure you\r\n  turned off all your media while you are away.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Home management insights</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  There is also something to be said for your ability to tap into insights on\r\n  how your home operates. You can monitor how often you watch TV, what kind of\r\n  meals you cook in your oven, the type of foods you keep in your refrigerator\r\n  and your energy consumption habits over time. From these insights, you may be\r\n  able to analyse your daily habits and behaviours, and make adjustments to live\r\n  the lifestyle you desire.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n<h2>World’s biggest tech companies and innovators have entered a race to outdo\r\n  one another in smart home technologies, which will result in bigger, better\r\n  smart home tech constantly being developed to match our digital needs.\r\n</h2>\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in the article belong solely to\r\n  the author, and not necessarily to the author's employer, organisation,\r\n  committee or other group or individual.\r\n</p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n","dir":"/blogs","path":"/blogs/Smart Home Automation","extension":".md","slug":"Smart Home Automation","createdAt":"2021-01-31T15:42:36.914Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-31T15:49:57.421Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1614332446944},"$loki":39},{"name":"Unity 3D - Why to go with it?","titleImage":"110520/unitytitle","briefdesc":"An article featuring the top features of Unity 3D that makes it stand out from the crowd.","postDate":"May 11, 2020","toc":[{"depth":2,"text":"Among todays game engines, Unity 3D is considered one of the best.

From there, you could have this technology through NVIDIA’s RTX\r\n  lineup.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Ray tracing has actually been around for long back before 2018 though. Movies\r\n  and TV shows have been using it to create amazing CG which entertained us with\r\n  incredible and real-life like visuals. What NVIDIA has produced (and soon, AMD\r\n  as well) is Real-time Ray tracing. Ray tracing requires a lot of horsepower,\r\n  which simply wasn’t a trait the predecessors of NVIDIA RTX lineup. Now, we can\r\n  render the same effects in everyday computers and as a result, we now have ray\r\n  tracing games.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>So, what is ray tracing?</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Ray tracing is a rendering technique that can produce incredibly realistic\r\n  lighting effects.

But, the benefits of ray tracing are much more about how it\r\n  interacts with the world rather than the light itself.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  Ray tracing improves translucence and scattering along with lifelike shadows\r\n  and reflections. Where the light hits is taken into account by the algorithm\r\n  and it calculates the interaction and interplay much like the human eye would\r\n  process real light, reflections and shadows.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  With enough computational power at your disposal, it is possible to produce\r\n  astonishingly realistic computer generated environments that are\r\n  indistinguishable from real life.

From traditional classroom environments to extreme training\r\n  situations, VR reduces investment and increases enrichment across a range of\r\n  industries. When it comes to absorbing, retaining, and applying new skills, VR\r\n  delivers distinct advantages.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>1. Offering Experiences That Promote Repetition and Retention</b\r\n><br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  New skills require practice. But what if the skill is heart surgery? And what\r\n  if you need to be able to strategise a response to an enemy ambush on the fly?\r\n  Simulations have been part of professional and military training as long as\r\n  anyone can remember, but it’s never been easy or cheap to set them up for the\r\n  sake of practice. VR training options offer controlled, easily generated\r\n  environments that allow for the repetition students need to master a new skill\r\n  or process.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  When it comes to a classroom environment, students often have trouble engaging\r\n  for long periods of time with limited stimulation. But when the classroom\r\n  suddenly transforms into the Amazon or the oval office, enthusiasm is\r\n  inevitable. A VR environment encourages information retention by offering\r\n  students fresh, immersive learning opportunities. With customisable sessions,\r\n  the responses of the teaching module can also evolve as the students improve\r\n  and retain.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>2. Reducing Training Budget and Providing Scalability</b><br /><br />\r\n<p>\r\n  VR is tied to results. It’s possible to collect metrics from virtual\r\n  education, showing the improvement in outcomes. Anything learned — whether\r\n  facts or skills — can be tested, and an organisation can easily compare\r\n  current methods to a virtual learning course. VR modules also provide feedback\r\n  during the training period, so instructors can iterate.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Savings also take the form of:</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside\">\r\n  <li>Equipment longevity.</li>\r\n  <li>Logistics reduction.</li>\r\n  <li>Time savings.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>3.

Absorbing material quickly, optimising\r\n  application, and streamlining interaction/workflow directly influences the\r\n  bottom line.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>VR is already making headway in a range of industries such as:</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside\">\r\n  <li>Healthcare.</li>\r\n  <li>Machine Operations.</li>\r\n  <li>Rehabilitation.</li>\r\n  <li>Corporate Training.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>4.

It’s not just\r\n  a schematic or a picture that you are making, you are actually making a\r\n  dynamic model that you are going to shift as you go through the design, the\r\n  build and the operation phase of what you do with the life-cycle of that\r\n  product.\r\n</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br /><b>Industry Context</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<picture>\r\n  <source srcset=\"/img/blog/261020/industry.webp\" type=\"image/webp\" />\r\n  <img style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain\"\r\n    src=\"/img/blog/261020/industry.jpg\" alt=\"Industry Context\" />\r\n</picture>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n  You may actually use the same product differently in two different industries\r\n  and have two different digital twins for that one product based on how the\r\n  industry uses that product.
